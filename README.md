# Machine Learning examples
This is a collection of machine learning code examples in different languages and libraries.

## Jupyter kernels
For machine learning I prefer to code in Jupyter Notebooks. There are additional Jupyter kernels available for other languages than Python, which is great if you wanna try out some stuff in Weka or R. I use the following kernels:
- SoS for R (available [here](https://github.com/vatlab/SOS))
- IJava for Java (available [here](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava))
A list of Jupyter kernels can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels).
