# Machine Learning examples
This is a collection of machine learning code examples in different languages and libraries.

## Jupyter kernels
For machine learning I prefer to code in Jupyter Notebooks. There are additional Jupyter kernels available for other languages than Python, which is great if you wanna try out some stuff in Weka or R. I use the following kernels:
- SoS for R (available [here](https://github.com/vatlab/SOS))
- IJava for Java (available [here](https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava))
A list of Jupyter kernels can be found [here](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/wiki/Jupyter-kernels). 

## Folders

**Keras** contains examples using Keras (checked for version 2.2.5) with TensorFlow backend (checked for version 1.14.0).

**R** contains a few examples using R. I am not a huge R fan, but have written some examples for students that prefer R.

**Weka** contains some examples using the Weka API (checked for version 3.8.3). The main benefit of Weka is its GUI, but learning how to use the API can sometimes be useful.

**sklearn** contains examples using Scikit-learn (checked for version 0.20.3). I usually prefer Scikit-learn for most tasks, along with Keras for deep learning.

**data** contains the datasets used in the code examples.

**images** Example images used for the pre-trained image recognition example in the Keras folder.
