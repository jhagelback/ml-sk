frighten players with either horror graphics scary ambience although combat can be part gameplay player made feel less control than typical action games through limited ammunition health speed vision through various obstructions players interaction with game mechanics player also challenged find items that unlock path new areas solve puzzles proceed game games make use strong horror themes like dark maze-like environments unexpected attacks from enemies term survival horror was first used for original japanese release resident evil first being alone dark which was influenced by earlier games with horror theme such 1989s sweet home name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay has been retroactively applied earlier titles starting with release resident evil genre began incorporate more features from action games more traditional first person third-person shooter games this has led game journalists question whether long-standing survival horror franchises more recent franchises have abandoned genre moved into different distinct genre often referred action horror still survival horror genre has persisted one form another contents definition game design o de-emphasized combat o enemy design history o origins 1980s–1996 o golden age 1996–2004 o transformation 2005–present see also references definition resident evil named defined survival horror genre survival horror refers subgenre horror video games player character vulnerable under-armed which puts emphasis on puzzle-solving evasion rather than violence games commonly challenge player manage their inventory ration scarce resources such ammunition another major theme throughout genre that isolation typically these games contain relatively few non-player characters result frequently tell much their story second-hand through usage journals texts audio logs while many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms enemies suspenseful environment survival horror games are distinct from otherwise horror-themed action games they tend de-emphasize combat favor challenges such hiding running from enemies solving puzzles still not unusual for survival horror games draw upon elements from first-person shooters action-adventure games even role-playing games survival horror different from typical game genres that not defined strictly by specific mechanics but subject matter tone pacing design philosophy game design de-emphasized combat survival horror games are subgenre horror games where player unable fully prepare arm their avatar player usually encounters several factors make combat unattractive primary option such limited number weapons invulnerable enemies if weapons are available their ammunition sparser than other games powerful weapons such rocket launchers are rare if even available at all thus players are more vulnerable than action games hostility environment sets up narrative where odds are weighed decisively against avatar this gameplay shifts away from direct combat players must learn evade enemies turn environment against them games try enhance experience vulnerability by making game single player rather than multiplayer by giving player avatar who more frail than typical action game hero survival horror genre also known for other non-combat challenges such solving puzzles at certain locations game world collecting managing inventory items areas game world will be off limits until player gains certain items occasionally levels are designed with alternative routes levels also challenge players with maze-like environments which test players navigational skills levels are often designed dark claustrophobic often making use dim shadowy light conditions camera angles sightlines which restrict visibility challenge player provide suspense although games genre also make use enormous spatial environments enemy design survival horror storyline usually involves investigation confrontation horrific forces thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges early releases utilized camera angles seen horror films which allowed enemies lurk areas that are concealed from players view also many survival horror games make use off-screen sound other warning cues notify player impending danger this feedback assists player but also creates feelings anxiety uncertainty games typically feature variety monsters with unique behavior patterns enemies can appear unexpectedly suddenly levels are often designed with scripted sequences where enemies drop from ceiling crash through windows survival horror games like many action-adventure games are structured around boss encounter where player must confront formidable opponent order advance next area these boss encounters draw elements from antagonists seen classic horror stories defeating boss will advance story game history origins 1980s–1996 origins survival horror game can be traced back earlier horror fiction archetypes have been linked books h p lovecraft which include investigative narratives journeys through depths comparisons have been made between lovecrafts cthulhoid old ones boss encounters seen many survival horror games themes survival have also been traced slasher film subgenre where protagonist endures confrontation with ultimate antagonist another major influence on genre japanese horror including classical noh theatre books edogawa rampo japanese cinema survival horror genre largely draws from both western mainly american asian mainly japanese traditions with western approach horror generally favouring action-oriented visceral horror while japanese approach tends favour psychological horror several games have been retroactively described survival horror nostromo was sci-fi survival horror game developed by akira takiguchi tokyo university student taito contractor for pet was ported pc-6001 by masakuni mitsuhashi also known hiromi ohba later joined game arts published by ascii exclusively for japan inspired by stealth game manibiki shoujo sci-fi horror film alien gameplay nostromo involved player attempting escape spaceship while avoiding sight invisible alien which only becomes visible when appearing front player gameplay also involved limited resources where player needs collect certain items order escape ship if certain required items are not available warehouse player unable escape eventually has no choice but be killed getting caught by alien malcolm evans monster maze released for sinclair zx81 first-person game without weapon player cannot fight enemy tyrannosaurus rex so must escape by finding exit before monster finds him game states its distance awareness player further raising tension edge stated was about fear panic terror facing implacable relentless foe who’s going get you end considers original survival horror game retro gamer stated survival horror may have been phrase first coined by resident evil but could’ve easily applied malcolm evans’ massive hit another early example atari game haunted house gameplay typical future survival horror titles emphasizes puzzle-solving evasive action rather than violence game uses monsters commonly featured horror fiction such bats ghosts each which has unique behaviors gameplay also incorporates item collection inventory management along with areas that are inaccessible until appropriate item found because has several features that have been seen later survival horror games some reviewers have retroactively classified this game first genre saw release another early horror game bandais terror house based on traditional japanese horror released bandai lcd solarpower handheld game was solar-powered game with two lcd panels on top each other enable impressive scene changes early pseudo-3d effects amount ambient light game received also had effect on gaming experience another early example horror game released that year was segas arcade game monster bash which introduced classic horror-movie monsters including likes dracula frankenstein monster werewolves helping lay foundations for future survival horror games its remake ghost house had gameplay specifically designed around horror theme featuring haunted house stages full traps secrets enemies that were fast powerful intimidating forcing players learn intricacies house rely on their wits another game that has been cited one first horror-themed games quicksilvas maze game ant attack magical zoos screamer was bio-horror rpg released for nec pc-88 that was set post-apocalyptic research facility while gameplay featured shooter-based combat permanent death latter half 1980s saw release several other horror-themed games including konamis castlevania segas kenseiden namcos splatterhouse though despite macabre imagery these games their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at time splatterhouse particular notable for its large amount bloodshed terror despite being arcade beat em up with very little emphasis on survival shiryou sensen war dead title developed by fun factory published by victor music industries for msx2 pc-88 pc engine platforms considered first true survival horror game by kevin gifford gamepro 1up john szczepaniak retro gamer escapist designed by katsuya iwamoto game was horror action rpg revolving around female swat member lila rescuing survivors isolated monster-infested town bringing them safety church has open environments like dragon quest real-time side-view battles like zelda ii though war dead departed from other rpgs with its dark creepy atmosphere expressed through storytelling graphics music player character has limited ammunition though player character can punch use knife if out ammunition game also has limited item inventory crates store items introduced day-night cycle player can sleep recover health record kept how many days player has survived that same year saw release laplace no ma another hybrid survival horror rpg though with more traditional rpg elements such turn-based combat mostly set mansion infested with undead creatures player controls party characters with different professions including scientist who constructs tools journalist who takes pictures war dead part for msx2 pc-88 abandoned rpg elements its predecessor such random encounters instead adopted action-adventure elements from metal gear while retaining horror atmosphere its predecessor sweet home pictured above was role-playing video game often called first survival horror cited main inspiration for resident evil however game often considered first true survival horror due having most influence on resident evil was release sweet home for nintendo entertainment system was created by tokuro fujiwara who would later go on create resident evil sweet homes gameplay focused on solving variety puzzles using items stored limited inventory while battling escaping from horrifying creatures which could lead permanent death for any characters thus creating tension emphasis on survival was also first attempt at creating scary frightening storyline within game mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before events game developed by capcom game would become main inspiration behind their later release resident evil which also borrowed various other elements from game such its mansion setting opening door load screen death animations multiple endings depending on which characters survive dual character paths individual character skills limited item management story told through diary entries frescos emphasis on atmosphere horrific imagery latter prevented its release western world though its influence was felt through resident evil which was originally intended be remake game some consider sweet home be first true survival horror game electronic arts published project firestart developed by dynamix unlike most other early games genre featured science fiction setting inspired by film alien but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games many ways fahs considers first achieve kind fully formed vision survival horror we know today citing its balance action adventure limited ammunition weak weaponry vulnerable main character feeling isolation storytelling through journals graphic violence use dynamically triggered music - all which are characteristic elements later games survival horror genre despite this not likely direct influence on later games genre similarities are largely example parallel thinking alone dark considered forefather survival horror genre sometimes called survival horror game retrospect infogrames released alone dark which has been considered forefather genre game featured lone protagonist against hordes monsters made use traditional adventure game challenges such puzzle-solving finding hidden keys new areas graphically alone dark utilized static prerendered camera views that were cinematic nature although players had ability fight monsters action games players also had option evade block them many monsters could not be killed thus could only be dealt with using problem-solving abilities game also used mechanism notes books expository devices many these elements were used later survival horror games thus game credited with making survival horror genre possible riverhillsoft released first fully survival horror game doctor hauzer for 3do both player character environment are rendered entirely polygons while allowing player switch view between three different perspectives third-person first-person overhead view departure from most other survival horror games before after doctor hauzer lacks any enemies main threat instead sentient house that game takes place with player having survive houses traps solve puzzles also uses background music that heightens tension changes depending on situation sound player characters echoing footsteps can change depending on surface these would later be used resident evil game today considered formative step creation survival horror genre improving on alone dark warps horror adventure game d featured first-person perspective cgi full-motion video gameplay that consisted entirely puzzle-solving taboo content such cannibalism same year human entertainments clock tower was survival horror game that employed point-and-click graphic adventure gameplay deadly stalker known scissorman that chases players throughout game game introduced stealth game elements was unique for its lack combat with player only able run away outsmart scissorman order survive features up nine different possible endings term survival horror was first used by capcom market their release resident evil resident evil adopted several features seen alone dark including its cinematic fixed camera angles some its puzzle-solving challenges control scheme resident evil also became staple genre future titles imitated its challenge rationing very limited resources items games commercial success credited with helping playstation become dominant game console also led series resident evil films many games have tried replicate successful formula seen resident evil every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken stance relation golden age 1996–2004 success resident evil was responsible for its template being used basis for wave successful survival horror games many which were referred resident evil clones golden age survival horror started by resident evil reached its peak around turn millennium with silent hill followed by general decline few years later among resident evil clones at time there were several survival horror titles that stood out such clock tower clock tower ghost head for playstation these clock tower games proved be hits capitalizing on success resident evil while staying true graphic-adventure gameplay original clock tower rather than following resident evil formula another survival horror title that differentiated itself was corpse party indie psychological horror adventure game created using rpg maker engine much like clock tower later haunting ground player characters corpse party lack any means defending themselves game also featured up possible endings however game would not be released western markets until another game similar clock tower series games haunting ground which was also inspired by resident evils success korean game known white day labyrinth named school this game was reportedly so scary that developers had release several patches adding multiple difficulty options game was slated for localization but was cancelled building on its previous success korea interest remake has been developed riverhillsofts overblood released considered one first survival horror games make use fully three-dimensional virtual environment second only riverhillsofts own doctor hauzer note hellnight experimented with using real-time first-person perspective rather than pre-rendered backgrounds like resident evil capcom released successful sequel resident evil which series creator shinji mikami intended tap into classic notion horror ordinary made strange thus rather than setting game creepy mansion no one would visit he wanted use familiar urban settings transformed by chaos viral outbreak game sold over five million copies proving popularity survival horror that year saw release squares parasite eve which combined elements from resident evil with rpg gameplay final fantasy was followed by more action-based sequel parasite eve ii galerians discarded use guns favour psychic powers that make difficult fight more than one enemy at time also blue stinger was fully survival horror for dreamcast incorporating action elements from beat em up shooter games silent hill series pictured above introduced psychological horror style genre most renowned was silent hill for its strong narrative konamis silent hill released drew heavily from resident evil while using realtime environments contrast resident evils pre-rendered graphics silent hill particular was praised for moving away from b movie horror elements psychological style seen art house japanese horror films due games emphasis on disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror game also featured stealth elements making use fog dodge enemies turning off flashlight avoid detection original silent hill considered one scariest games all time strong narrative from silent hill has made silent hill series one most influential genre according ign golden age survival horror came crescendo with release silent hill also capcom released original dino crisis which was noted for incorporating certain elements from survival horror games was followed by more action-based sequel dino crisis fatal frame from was unique entry into genre player explores mansion takes photographs ghosts order defeat them fatal frame series has since gained reputation one most distinctive genre with first game series credited one best-written survival horror games ever made by ugo networks meanwhile capcom incorporated shooter elements into several survival horror titles such 2000s resident evil survivor which used both light gun shooter first-person shooter elements 2003s resident evil dead aim which used light gun third-person shooter elements western developers began return survival horror formula thing from has been called survival horror game although distinct from other titles genre due its emphasis on action challenge holding team together title doom sometimes categorized survival horror although considered americanized take on genre due players ability directly confront monsters with weaponry thus usually considered first-person shooter with survival horror elements regardless genres increased popularity led western developers incorporate horror elements into action games rather than follow japanese survival style overall traditional survival horror genre continued be dominated by japanese designers aesthetics 2002s clock tower eschewed graphic adventure game formula seen original clock tower embraced full survival horror gameplay resident evil outbreak introduced new gameplay element genre online multiplayer cooperative gameplay sony employed silent hill director keiichiro toyama develop siren game was released added unprecedented challenge genre by making player mostly defenseless thus making vital learn enemys patrol routes hide from them however reviewers eventually criticized traditional japanese survival horror formula for becoming stagnant console market drifted towards western-style action games players became impatient with limited resources cumbersome controls seen japanese titles such resident evil code veronica silent hill room transformation 2005–present recent years developers have combined traditional survival horror gameplay with other concepts left dead fused survival horror with cooperative multiplayer action resident evil attempted redefine genre by emphasizing reflexes precision aiming broadening gameplay with elements from wider action genre its ambitions paid off earning title several game year awards for top rank on igns readers picks top games list however this also led some reviewers suggest that resident evil series had abandoned survival horror genre by demolishing genre conventions that had established other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems feature more action such silent hill homecoming version alone dark these changes were part overall trend among console games shift towards visceral action gameplay these changes gameplay have led some purists suggest that genre has deteriorated into conventions other action games jim sterling suggests that genre lost its core gameplay when improved combat interface thus shifting gameplay away from hiding running towards direct combat leigh alexander argues that this represents shift towards more western horror aesthetics which emphasize action gore rather than psychological experience japanese horror original genre has persisted one form another release fear was praised for both its atmospheric tension fast action successfully combining japanese horror with cinematic action while dead space from brought survival horror science fiction setting however critics argue that these titles represent continuing trend away from pure survival horror towards general action release left dead helped popularize cooperative multiplayer among survival horror games although mostly first person shooter at its core meanwhile fatal frame series has remained true roots genre even fatal frame iv transitioned from use fixed cameras over-the-shoulder viewpoint also silent hill made transition over-the-shoulder viewpoint silent hill shattered memories this wii effort was however considered by most reviewers return form for series due several developmental decisions taken by climax studios this included decision openly break fourth wall by psychologically profiling player decision remove any weapons from game forcing player run whenever they see enemy examples independent survival horror games are penumbra series amnesia dark descent by frictional games cry fear by team psykskallar slender eight pages all which were praised for creating horrific setting atmosphere without overuse violence gore cult game deadly premonition by access games was notable for introducing open world nonlinear gameplay comedy horror theme genre overall game developers have continued make release survival horror games genre continues grow among independent video game developers naughty dog released last us shinji mikami creator resident evil franchise released his new survival horror game evil within mikami stated that his goal was bring survival horror back its roots even though this his last directorial work he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action see also list

'abstraction software engineering from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from abstraction computer science jump navigation search this article needs additional citations for verification please help improve this article by adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed june learn how when remove this template message essence abstractions preserving information that relevant given context forgetting information that irrelevant that context – john v guttag software engineering computer science abstraction technique for arranging complexity computer systems works by establishing level complexity on which person interacts with system suppressing more complex details below current level programmer works with idealized interface usually well defined can add additional levels functionality that would otherwise be too complex handle for example programmer writing code that involves numerical operations may not be interested way numbers are represented underlying hardware eg whether theyre bit bit integers where those details have been suppressed can be said that they were abstracted away leaving simply numbers with which programmer can work addition task sending email message across continents would be extremely complex if you start with piece optic cable basic hardware components by using layers complexity that have been created abstract away physical cables network layout presenting programmer with virtual data channel this task manageable abstraction can apply control data control abstraction abstraction actions while data abstraction that data structures control abstraction involves use subprograms related concepts control flows data abstraction allows handling data bits meaningful ways for example basic motivation behind datatype one can view notion object way combine abstractions data code same abstract definition can be used common interface for family objects with different implementations behaviors but which share same meaning inheritance mechanism object-oriented programming can be used define abstract class common interface recommendation that programmers use abstractions whenever suitable order avoid duplication usually code known abstraction principle requirement that programming language provide suitable abstractions also called abstraction principle contents rationale language features o programming languages o specification methods o specification languages control abstraction o structured programming data abstraction abstraction object oriented programming o object-oriented design considerations levels abstraction o database systems o layered architecture see also references further reading external links rationale computing mostly operates independently concrete world hardware implements model computation that interchangeable with others software structured architectures enable humans create enormous systems by concentrating on few issues at time these architectures are made specific choices abstractions greenspuns tenth rule aphorism on how such architecture both inevitable complex central form abstraction computing language abstraction new artificial languages are developed express specific aspects system modeling languages help planning computer languages can be processed with computer example this abstraction process generational development programming languages from machine language assembly language high-level language each stage can be used stepping stone for next stage language abstraction continues for example scripting languages domain-specific programming languages within programming language some features let programmer create new abstractions these include subroutines modules polymorphism software components some other abstractions such software design patterns architectural styles remain invisible programming language operate only design system some abstractions try limit breadth concepts programmer needs by completely hiding abstractions that turn are built on software engineer writer joel spolsky has criticised these efforts by claiming that all abstractions are leaky — that they can never completely hide details below however this does not negate usefulness abstraction some abstractions are designed interoperate with others for example programming language may contain foreign function interface for making calls lower-level language data abstraction separation between specification data object its implementation language features programming languages main article programming language different programming languages provide different types abstraction depending on intended applications for language for example object-oriented programming languages such c++ object pascal java concept abstraction has itself become declarative statement – using keywords virtual c++ abstract interface java after such declaration responsibility programmer implement class instantiate object declaration functional programming languages commonly exhibit abstractions related functions such lambda abstractions making term into function some variable higher-order functions parameters are functions bracket abstraction making term into function variable modern lisps such clojure scheme common lisp support macro systems allow syntactic abstraction this allows lisp programmer eliminate boilerplate code abstract away tedious function call sequences implement new control flow structures implement even build domain specific languages dsls which allow domain-specific concepts be expressed some optimised way all these when used correctly improve both programmers efficiency clarity code by making intended purpose more explicit consequence syntactic abstraction also that any lisp dialect fact almost any programming language can principle be implemented any modern lisp with significantly reduced but still non-trivial some cases effort when compared more traditional programming languages such python c java specification methods main article formal specification analysts have developed various methods formally specify software systems some known methods include abstract-model based method vdm z algebraic techniques larch clear obj act one casl process-based techniques lotos sdl estelle trace-based techniques special tam knowledge-based techniques refine gist specification languages main article specification language specification languages generally rely on abstractions one kind another since specifications are typically defined earlier project at more abstract level than eventual implementation uml specification language for example allows definition abstract classes which remain abstract during architecture specification phase project control abstraction main article control flow programming languages offer control abstraction one main purposes their use computer machines understand operations at very low level such moving some bits from one location memory another location producing sum two sequences bits programming languages allow this be done higher level for example consider this statement written pascal-like fashion = + human this seems fairly simple obvious calculation one plus two three times five fifteen however low-level steps necessary carry out this evaluation return value then assign that value variable are actually quite subtle complex values need be converted binary representation often much more complicated task than one would think calculations decomposed by compiler interpreter into assembly instructions again which are much less intuitive programmer operations such shifting binary register left adding binary complement contents one register another are simply not how humans think about abstract arithmetical operations addition multiplication finally assigning resulting value variable labeled so that can be used later involves additional behind-the-scenes steps looking up variables label resultant location physical virtual memory storing binary representation that memory location etc without control abstraction programmer would need specify all register/binary-level steps each time they simply wanted add multiply couple numbers assign result variable such duplication effort has two serious negative consequences forces programmer constantly repeat fairly common tasks every time similar operation needed forces programmer program for particular hardware instruction set structured programming main article structured programming structured programming involves splitting complex program tasks into smaller pieces with clear flow-control interfaces between components with reduction complexity potential for side-effects simple program this may aim ensure that loops have single obvious exit points where possible have single exit points from functions procedures larger system may involve breaking down complex tasks into many different modules consider system which handles payroll on ships at shore offices uppermost level may feature menu typical end-user operations within that could be standalone executables libraries for tasks such signing on off employees printing checks within each those standalone components there could be many different source files each containing program code handle part problem with only selected interfaces available other parts program sign on program could have source files for each data entry screen database interface which may itself be standalone third party library statically linked set library routines either database payroll application also has initiate process exchanging data with between ship shore that data transfer task will often contain many other components these layers produce effect isolating implementation details one component its assorted internal methods from others object-oriented programming embraces extends this concept data abstraction main article abstract data type data abstraction enforces clear separation between abstract properties data type concrete details its implementation abstract properties are those that are visible client code that makes use data type—the interface data type—while concrete implementation kept entirely private indeed can change for example incorporate efficiency improvements over time idea that such changes are not supposed have any impact on client code since they involve no difference abstract behaviour for example one could define abstract data type called lookup table which uniquely associates keys with values which values may be retrieved by specifying their corresponding keys such lookup table may be implemented various ways hash table binary search tree even simple linear list keyvalue pairs far client code concerned abstract properties type are same each case course this all relies on getting details interface right first place since any changes there can have major impacts on client code one way look at this interface forms contract on agreed behaviour between data type client code anything not spelled out contract subject change without notice languages that implement data abstraction include ada modula-2 object-oriented languages are commonly claimed offer data abstraction however their inheritance concept tends put information interface that more properly belongs implementation thus changes such information ends up impacting client code leading directly fragile binary interface problem abstraction object oriented programming main article object computer science object-oriented programming theory abstraction involves facility define objects that represent abstract actors that can perform work report on change their state communicate with other objects system term encapsulation refers hiding state details but extending concept data type from earlier programming languages associate behavior most strongly with data standardizing way that different data types interact beginning abstraction when abstraction proceeds into operations defined enabling objects different types be substituted called polymorphism when proceeds opposite direction inside types classes structuring them simplify complex set relationships called delegation inheritance various object-oriented programming languages offer similar facilities for abstraction all support general strategy polymorphism object-oriented programming which includes substitution one type for another same similar role although not generally supported configuration image package may predetermine great many these bindings

'formal language from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search this article about technical term mathematics computer science for related studies about natural languages see formal semantics linguistics for formal modes speech natural languages see register sociolinguistics structure syntactically well-formed although nonsensical english sentence historical example from chomsky mathematics computer science linguistics formal language set strings symbols that may be constrained by rules that are specific alphabet formal language set symbols letters tokens from which strings language may be formed frequently required be finite strings formed from this alphabet are called words words that belong particular formal language are sometimes called well-formed words well-formed formulas formal language often defined by means formal grammar such regular grammar context-free grammar also called its formation rule field formal language theory studies primarily purely syntactical aspects such languages—that their internal structural patterns formal language theory sprang out linguistics way understanding syntactic regularities natural languages computer science formal languages are used among others basis for defining grammar programming languages formalized versions subsets natural languages which words language represent concepts that are associated with particular meanings semantics computational complexity theory decision problems are typically defined formal languages complexity classes are defined sets formal languages that can be parsed by machines with limited computational power logic foundations mathematics formal languages are used represent syntax axiomatic systems mathematical formalism philosophy that all mathematics can be reduced syntactic manipulation formal languages this way contents history words over alphabet definition examples o constructions language-specification formalisms operations on languages applications o programming languages o formal theories systems proofs + interpretations models see also references o citation footnotes o general references external links history ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding april first formal language thought be one used by gottlob frege his begriffsschrift literally meaning concept writing which frege described formal language pure thought axel thues early semi-thue system which can be used for rewriting strings was influential on formal grammars words over alphabet alphabet context formal languages can be any set although often makes sense use alphabet usual sense word more generally character set such ascii unicode alphabets can also be infinite eg first-order logic often expressed using alphabet which besides symbols such ∧ ¬ ∀ parentheses contains infinitely many elements x0 x1 x2 … that play role variables elements alphabet are called its letters word over alphabet can be any finite sequence string characters letters which sometimes may include spaces are separated by specified word separation characters set all words over alphabet σ usually denoted by σ using kleene star length word number characters letters composed for any alphabet there only one word length empty word which often denoted by e ε λ by concatenation one can combine two words form new word whose length sum lengths original words result concatenating word with empty word original word some applications especially logic alphabet also known vocabulary words are known formulas sentences this breaks letter/word metaphor replaces by word/sentence metaphor definition formal language l over alphabet σ subset σ that set words over that alphabet sometimes sets words are grouped into expressions whereas rules constraints may be formulated for creation well-formed expressions computer science mathematics which do not usually deal with natural languages adjective formal often omitted redundant while formal language theory usually concerns itself with formal languages that are described by some syntactical rules actual definition concept formal language only above possibly infinite set finite-length strings composed from given alphabet no more nor less practice there are many languages that can be described by rules such regular languages context-free languages notion formal grammar may be closer intuitive concept language one described by syntactic rules by abuse definition particular formal language often thought being equipped with formal grammar that describes examples following rules describe formal language l over alphabet σ = { 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 + = } every nonempty string that does not contain + = does not start with l string l string containing = l if only if there exactly one = separates two valid strings l string containing + but not = l if only if every + string separates two valid strings l no string l other than those implied by previous rules under these rules string 23+4=555 l but string =234=+ not this formal language expresses natural numbers well-formed addition statements well-formed addition equalities but expresses only what they look like their syntax not what they mean semantics for instance nowhere these rules there any indication that means number zero that + means addition constructions for finite languages one can explicitly enumerate all well-formed words for example we can describe language l just l = {a b ab cba} degenerate case this construction empty language which contains no words at all l = ∅ however even over finite non-empty alphabet such σ = {a b} there are infinite number words that can potentially be expressed abb ababba aaababbbbaab … therefore formal languages are typically infinite describing infinite formal language not simple writing l = {a b ab cba} here are some examples formal languages l = σ set all words over σ l = {a} = {an} where n ranges over natural numbers n means repeated n times this set words consisting only symbol set syntactically correct programs given programming language syntax which usually defined by context-free grammar set inputs upon which certain turing machine halts set maximal strings alphanumeric ascii characters on this line ie set {the set maximal strings alphanumeric ascii characters on this line i e} language-specification formalisms formal languages are used tools multiple disciplines however formal language theory rarely concerns itself with particular languages except examples but mainly concerned with study various types formalisms describe languages for instance language can be given those strings generated by some formal grammar those strings described matched by particular regular expression those strings accepted by some automaton such turing machine finite state automaton those strings for which some decision procedure algorithm that asks sequence related yes/no questions produces answer yes typical questions asked about such formalisms include what their expressive power can formalism x describe every language that formalism y can describe can describe other languages what their recognizability how difficult decide whether given word belongs language described by formalism x what their comparability how difficult decide whether two languages one described formalism x one formalism y x again are actually same language surprisingly often answer these decision problems cannot be done at all extremely expensive with characterization how expensive therefore formal language theory major application area computability theory complexity theory formal languages may be classified chomsky hierarchy based on expressive power their generative grammar well complexity their recognizing automaton context-free grammars regular grammars provide good compromise between expressivity ease parsing are widely used practical applications operations on languages certain operations on languages are common this includes standard set operations such union intersection complement another class operation element-wise application string operations examples suppose l1 l2 are languages over some common alphabet concatenation l1l2 consists all strings form vw where v string from l1 w string from l2 intersection l1 ∩ l2 l1 l2 consists all strings which are contained both languages complement ¬l language with respect given alphabet consists all strings over alphabet that are not language kleene star language consisting all words that are concatenations more words original language reversal o let e be empty word then er = e o for each non-empty word w = x1…xn over some alphabet let wr = xn…x1 o then for formal language l lr = {wr | w ∈ l} string homomorphism such string operations are used investigate closure properties classes languages class languages closed under particular operation when operation applied languages class always produces language same class again for instance context-free languages are known be closed under union concatenation intersection with regular languages but not closed under intersection complement theory trios abstract families languages studies most common closure properties language families their own right closure properties language families l {\displaystyle l{1}} op l {\displaystyle l{2}} where both l {\displaystyle l{1}} l {\displaystyle l{2}} are

languages compiler compiler compiler usually has two distinct components lexical analyzer generated by tool like lex identifies tokens programming language grammar eg identifiers keywords which are themselves expressed simpler formal language usually by means regular expressions at most basic conceptual level parser usually generated by parser generator like yacc attempts decide if source program valid that if belongs programming language for which compiler was built course compilers do more than just parse source code — they usually translate into some executable format because this parser usually outputs more than yes/no answer typically abstract syntax tree this used by subsequent stages compiler eventually generate executable containing machine code that runs directly on hardware some intermediate code that requires virtual machine execute formal theories systems proofs this diagram shows syntactic divisions within formal system strings symbols may be broadly divided into nonsense well-formed formulas set well-formed formulas divided into theorems non-theorems main articles theory mathematical logic formal system mathematical logic formal theory set sentences expressed formal language formal system also called logical calculus logical system consists formal language together with deductive apparatus also called deductive system deductive apparatus may consist set transformation rules which may be interpreted valid rules inference set axioms have both formal system used derive one expression from one more other expressions although formal language can be identified with its formulas formal system cannot be likewise identified by its theorems two formal systems f s {\displaystyle {\mathcal {fs}}} f s ′ {\displaystyle {\mathcal {fs}}} may have all same theorems yet differ some significant proof-theoretic way formula may be syntactic consequence formula b one but not another for instance formal proof derivation finite sequence well-formed formulas which may be interpreted propositions each which axiom follows from preceding formulas sequence by rule inference last sentence sequence theorem formal system formal proofs are useful because their theorems can be interpreted true propositions interpretations models main articles formal semantics logic interpretation logic model theory formal languages are entirely syntactic nature but may be given semantics that give meaning elements language for instance mathematical logic set possible formulas particular logic formal language interpretation assigns meaning each formulas—usually truth value study interpretations formal languages called formal semantics mathematical logic this often done terms model theory model theory terms that occur formula are interpreted mathematical structures

console pc components decline arcade video games had declined popularity so much by late 1990s that revenues united states dropped $133 billion reached low $866 million furthermore by early 2000s networked gaming via computers then consoles across internet had also appeared replacing venue head-to-head competition social atmosphere once provided solely by arcades arcades also lost their status forefront new game releases given choice between playing game at arcade three four times perhaps minutes play for typical arcade game renting at about same price exactly same game—for video game console—the console became preferred choice fighting games were most attractive feature for arcades since they offered prospect face-to-face competition tournaments which correspondingly led players

narrativists have given heroine game tomb raider saying that dimensions lara crofts body already analyzed death by film theorists are irrelevant me player because different-looking body would not make me play differently when i play i dont even see her body but see through past simply put ludologists reject traditional theories art because they claim that artistic socially relevant qualities video game are primarily determined by underlying set rules demands expectations imposed on player while many games rely on emergent principles video games commonly present simulated story worlds where emergent behavior occurs within context game term emergent narrative has been used describe how simulated environment storyline can be created simply by what happens player however emergent behavior not limited sophisticated games general any place where event-driven instructions occur for ai game emergent behavior will exist for instance take racing game which cars are programmed avoid crashing

cooperatively by using either multiple input devices by hotseating tennis for two arguably first video game was two player game was its successor pong first commercially available game console magnavox odyssey had two controller inputs since then most consoles have been shipped with two four controller inputs some have had ability expand four eight many inputs with additional adapters such multitap multiplayer arcade games typically feature play for two four players sometimes tilting monitor on its back for top-down viewing experience allowing players sit opposite one another many early computer games for non-pc descendant based platforms featured multiplayer support personal computer systems from atari commodore both regularly featured at least two game ports pc-based computer games started with lower availability multiplayer options because technical limitations pcs typically had either one no game ports at all network games for these early personal computers were generally limited only text based adventures muds that were played remotely on dedicated server this was due both slow speed modems 300-1200-bit/s prohibitive cost involved with putting computer online such way where multiple visitors could make use however with advent widespread local area networking technologies internet based online capabilities number players modern games can be higher sometimes featuring integrated text and/or voice chat massively multiplayer online game mmos can offer extremely high numbers simultaneous players eve online set record with players on single server behavioral effects main article video game behavioral effects has been shown that action video game players have better hand–eye coordination visuo-motor skills such their resistance distraction their sensitivity information peripheral vision their ability count briefly presented objects than nonplayers researchers found that such enhanced abilities could be acquired by training with action games involving challenges that switch attention between different locations but not with games requiring concentration on single objects has been suggested by few studies that online/offline video gaming can be used therapeutic tool treatment different mental health concerns steven johnsons book everything bad good for you he argues that video games fact demand far more from player than traditional games like monopoly experience game player must first determine objectives well how complete them they must then learn game controls how human-machine interface works including menus huds beyond such skills which after some time become quite fundamental are taken for granted by many gamers video games are based upon player navigating eventually mastering highly complex system with many variables this requires strong analytical ability well flexibility adaptability he argues that process learning boundaries goals controls given game often highly demanding one that calls on many different areas cognitive function indeed most games require great deal patience focus from player contrary popular perception that games provide instant gratification games actually delay gratification far longer than other forms entertainment such film even many books some research suggests video games may even increase players attention capacities learning principles found video games have been identified possible techniques with which reform us education system has been noticed that gamers adopt attitude while playing that such high concentration they do not realize they are learning that if same attitude could be adopted at school education would enjoy significant benefits students are found be learning by doing while playing video games while fostering creative thinking us army has deployed

types video games can improve gamers dexterity well their ability problem-solve study laparoscopic surgeons found that those who played video games were percent faster at advanced surgical procedures made percent fewer errors compared those who did not play video games second study laparoscopic surgeons percent men percent women also showed that surgeons who played video games requiring spatial skills hand dexterity then performed drill testing these skills were significantly faster at their first attempt across all trials than surgeons who did not play video games first research showing benefits from action games has been questioned due methodological shortcomings such recruitment strategies selection bias potential placebo effects lack baseline improvements control groups addition many studies are cross-sectional longitudinal interventional trials not all have found effects response this pointed out that skill improvements from action games are more broad than predicted such mental rotation which not common task action games action gamers are not only better at ignoring distractions but also at focusing on main task objections video games main article video game controversies like other media such rock music notably heavy metal music video games have been subject objections controversies censorship for instance because depictions violence sexual themes alcohol tobacco other drugs propaganda profanity advertisements critics video games include parents groups politicians religious groups scientists other advocacy groups claims that some video games cause addiction violent behavior continue be made be disputed there have been number societal scientific arguments about whether content video games change behavior attitudes player whether this reflected video game culture overall since early 1980s advocates video games have emphasized their use expressive medium arguing for their protection under laws governing freedom speech also educational tool detractors argue that video games are harmful therefore should be subject legislative oversight restrictions positive negative characteristics effects video games are subject scientific study results investigations into links between video games addiction aggression violence social development variety stereotyping sexual morality issues are debated if video game contains large amounts violence can cause person behave more aggressively study was done that showed that young people who have had greater exposure violence video games ended up behaving more aggressively towards people social environment possible benefits spite negative effects video games certain studies indicate that they may have value terms academic performance perhaps because skills that are developed process “when you play games you’re solving puzzles move next level that involves using some general knowledge skills maths reading science that you’ve been taught during day” said alberto posso associate professor at royal melbourne institute technology after analysing data from results standardized testing completed by over high school students across australia summarized by guardian study found that students who played online games almost every day scored points above average maths reading tests points above average science however reporter added important comment that was not provided by some numerous web sites that published brief summary australian study study methodology cannot prove that playing video games were cause improvement guardian also reported that columbia university study indicated that extensive video gaming by students age group provided greatly increased chance high intellectual functioning overall school competence interview with cnn edward castronova professor telecommunications at indiana university bloomington said he was not surprised by outcome australian study but also discussed issue causal connection though there link between gaming higher math science scores doesnt mean playing games caused higher scores could just be that kids who are sharp are looking for challenge they dont find on social media maybe they do find on

greatly simplified calculations that involved multiplication division slide rule since real numbers can be represented distances intervals on line slide rule was invented 1620s shortly after napiers work allow multiplication division operations be carried out significantly faster than was previously possible edmund gunter built calculating device with single logarithmic scale at university oxford his device greatly simplified arithmetic calculations including multiplication division william oughtred greatly improved this with his circular slide rule he followed this up with modern slide rule

unworthy excellent men lose hours like slaves labour calculation which could safely be relegated anyone else if machines were used however leibniz did not incorporate fully successful carry mechanism leibniz also described binary numeral system central ingredient all modern computers however up 1940s many subsequent designs including charles babbages machines even eniac were based on decimal

moore school electrical engineering where eniac was built fully electronic general-purpose analog computer was built by helmut hölzer at peenemünde army research center by 1950s success digital electronic computers had spelled end for most analog computing machines but hybrid analog computers controlled by digital electronics remained substantial use into 1950s 1960s later some specialized applications advent digital computer principle modern computer was first described by computer scientist alan turing who set out idea his seminal paper on computable numbers turing reformulated kurt gödels results on limits proof computation replacing gödels universal arithmetic-based formal language with formal simple hypothetical devices that became known turing machines he proved that some such machine would be capable performing any conceivable mathematical computation if were representable algorithm he went on prove that there was no solution entscheidungsproblem by first showing that halting problem for turing machines undecidable general not possible decide algorithmically whether given turing machine will ever halt he also introduced notion universal machine now known universal turing machine with idea that such machine could perform tasks any other machine other words provably capable computing anything that computable by executing program stored on tape allowing machine be programmable von neumann acknowledged that central concept modern computer was due this paper turing machines are this day central object study theory computation except for limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said be turing-complete which say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent universal turing machine electromechanical computers era modern computing began with flurry development before during world war ii most digital computers built this period were electromechanical - electric switches drove mechanical relays perform calculation these devices had low operating speed were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers originally using vacuum tubes z2 was one earliest examples electromechanical relay computer was created by german engineer konrad zuse was improvement on his earlier z1 although used same mechanical memory replaced arithmetic control logic with electrical relay circuits replica zuses z3 first fully automatic digital electromechanical computer same year electro-mechanical devices called bombes were built by british cryptologists help decipher german enigma-machine-encrypted secret messages during world war ii initial design bombe was produced at uk government code cypher school gc&cs at bletchley park by alan turing with important refinement devised by gordon welchman engineering design

cryptologic bomb polish bomba kryptologiczna zuse followed his earlier machine up with z3 worlds first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer z3 was built with relays implementing bit word length that operated at clock frequency about 5–10 hz program code data were stored on punched film was quite similar modern machines some respects pioneering numerous advances such floating point numbers replacement hard-to-implement decimal system used charles babbages earlier design by simpler binary system meant that zuses machines were easier build potentially more reliable given technologies available at that time z3 was probably complete turing machine two patent applications zuse also anticipated that machine instructions could be stored same storage used for data—the key insight what became known von neumann architecture first implemented british ssem zuse suffered setbacks during world war ii when some his machines were destroyed course allied bombing campaigns apparently his work remained largely unknown engineers uk us until much later although at least ibm was aware financed his post-war startup company return for option on zuses patents harvard mark i was constructed at ibms endicott laboratories was similar general purpose electro-mechanical computer z3 but was not quite turing-complete digital computation mathematical basis digital computing boolean algebra developed by british mathematician george boole his work laws thought published his boolean algebra was further refined 1860s by william jevons charles sanders peirce was first presented systematically by ernst schröder n whitehead 1930s working independently american electronic engineer claude shannon soviet logician victor shestakov both showed one-to-one correspondence between concepts boolean logic certain electrical circuits now called logic gates which are now ubiquitous digital computers they showed that electronic relays switches can realize

games use much same terminology settings game mechanics early pen-and-paper role-playing games such dungeons & dragons players control central game character multiple game characters usually called party attain victory by completing series quests reaching conclusion central storyline players explore game world while solving puzzles engaging tactical combat key feature genre that characters grow power abilities characters are typically designed by player rpgs rarely challenge players physical coordination reaction time with exception action role-playing games role-playing video games typically rely on highly developed story setting which divided into number quests players control one several characters by issuing commands which are performed by character at effectiveness determined by that characters numeric attributes often these attributes increase each time character gains level characters level goes up each time player accumulates certain amount experience role-playing video games also typically attempt offer more complex dynamic character interaction than what found other video game genres this usually involves additional focus on artificial intelligence scripted behavior computer-controlled non-player characters story setting premise most role-playing games tasks player with saving world whichever level society threatened there are often twists turns story progresses such surprise appearance estranged relatives enemies who become friends vice versa game world tends be set fantasy science fiction universe which allows players do things they cannot do real life helps players suspend their disbelief about rapid character growth lesser extent settings closer present day near future are possible story often provides much entertainment game because these games have strong storylines they can often make effective use recorded dialog voiceover narration players these games tend appreciate long cutscenes more than players faster action games while most games advance plot when player defeats enemy completes level role-playing games often progress plot based on other important decisions for example player may make decision join guild thus triggering progression storyline that usually irreversible new elements story may also be triggered by mere arrival area rather than completing specific challenge plot usually divided so that each game location opportunity reveal new chapter story pen-and-paper role-playing games typically involve player called gamemaster gm for short who can dynamically create story setting rules react players choices role-playing video games computer performs function gamemaster this offers player smaller set possible actions since computers cant engage imaginative acting comparable skilled human gamemaster exchange typical role-playing video game may have storyline branches user interfaces stylized cutscenes gameplay offer more direct storytelling mechanism characterization non-player characters video games often handled using dialog tree saying right things right non-player characters will elicit useful information for player may even result other rewards such items experience well opening up possible storyline branches multiplayer online role-playing games can offer exception this contrast by allowing human interaction among multiple players some cases enabling player perform role gamemaster exploration quests overworld map from tactical rpg battle for wesnoth exploring world important aspect all rpgs players will walk through talking non-player characters picking up objects avoiding traps some games such nethack diablo fate series randomize structure individual levels increasing games variety replayability role-playing games where players complete quests by exploring randomly generated dungeons include game mechanic permadeath are called roguelikes named after video game rogue games story often mapped onto exploration where each chapter story mapped onto different location rpgs usually allow players return previously visited locations usually there nothing left do there although some locations change throughout story offer player new things do response players must acquire enough power overcome major challenge order progress next area this structure can be compared boss characters at end levels action games player typically must complete linear sequence certain quests order reach end games story although quests some games such arcanum geneforge can limit enable certain choices later game many rpgs also often allow player seek out optional side-quests character interactions quests this sort can be found by talking non-player character there may be no penalty for abandoning ignoring these quests other than missed opportunity reward quests may involve defeating one many enemies rescuing non-player character item fetch quests locational puzzles such mysteriously locked doors items inventory players can find loot such clothing weapons armor throughout game world collect players can trade items for currency better equipment trade takes place while interacting with certain friendly non-player characters such shopkeepers often uses specialized trading screen purchased items go into players inventory some games turn inventory management into logistical challenge by limiting size players inventory thus forcing player decide what they must carry at time this can be done by limiting maximum weight that player can carry by employing system arranging items virtual space by simply limiting number items that can be held character actions abilities character information inventory screen typical computer role-playing game pictured here roguelike scourge heroes lesser renown most actions rpg are performed indirectly with player selecting action character performing by their own accord success at that action depends on characters numeric attributes role-playing video games often simulate die-rolling mechanics from non-electronic role-playing games determine success failure characters attributes improve their chances succeeding at particular action will increase many role-playing games allow players play evil character although robbing murdering indiscriminately may make easier get money there are usually consequences that other characters will become uncooperative even hostile towards player thus these games allow players make moral choices but force players live with consequences their actions games often let player control entire party characters however if winning contingent upon survival single character then that character effectively becomes players avatar example this would be baldurs gate where if character created by player dies game ends previous save needs be loaded although some single-player role-playing games give player avatar that largely predefined for sake telling specific story many role-playing games make use character creation screen this allows players choose their characters sex their race species their character class although many theses traits are cosmetic there are functional aspects well character classes will have different abilities strengths common classes include fighters spellcasters thieves with stealth abilities clerics with healing abilities mixed class such fighter who can cast simple spells characters will also have range physical attributes such dexterity strength which affect players performance combat mental attributes such intelligence may affect players ability perform learn spells while social attributes such charisma may limit players choices while conversing with non-player characters these attribute systems often strongly resemble dungeons & dragons ruleset some role-playing games make use magical powers equivalents such psychic powers advanced technology these abilities are confined specific characters such mages spellcasters magic-users games where player controls multiple characters these magic-users usually complement physical strength other classes magic can be used attack defend temporarily change enemy allys attributes while some games allow players gradually consume spell ammunition consumed by gun most games offer players finite amount mana which can be spent on any spell mana restored by resting by consuming potions characters can also gain other non-magical skills which stay with character long he lives experience levels example character creation video game although characterization games avatar will develop through storytelling characters may also become more functionally powerful by gaining new skills weapons magic this creates positive-feedback cycle that central most role-playing games player grows power allowing them overcome more difficult challenges gain even more power this part appeal genre where players experience growing from ordinary person into superhero with amazing powers whereas other games give player these powers immediately player role-playing game will choose their powers skills they gain experience role-playing games usually measure progress by counting experience points character levels experience usually earned by defeating enemies combat with some games offering experience for completing certain quests conversations experience becomes form score accumulating certain amount experience will cause characters level go up this called levelling up gives player opportunity raise one more his characters attributes many rpgs allow players choose how improve their character by allocating finite number points into attributes their choice gaining experience will also unlock new magic spells for characters that use magic some role-playing games also give player specific skill points which can be used

by winning battles performing class-specific activities completing quests once certain amount experience gained character advances level some games level-up occurs automatically when required amount experience reached others player can choose when where advance level likewise abilities attributes may increase automatically manually training system similar way basic role-playing system works first video game use this was dungeon master emphasizes developing characters skills by using them—meaning that if character wields sword for some time he she will become proficient with finally skill-point system used vampire masquerade – bloodlines for example character rewarded with skill points for completing quests which then can be directly used buy skills and/or attributes without having wait until next level up combat further information turns rounds time-keeping systems games older games often separated combat into its own mode gameplay distinct from exploring game world more recent games tend maintain consistent perspective for exploration combat some games especially earlier video games generate battles from random encounters more modern rpgs are more likely have persistent wandering monsters that move about game world independently player most rpgs also use stationary boss monsters key positions automatically trigger battles with them when pcs enter these locations perform certain actions combat options typically involve positioning characters selecting which enemy attack exercising special skills such casting spells classical turn-based system only one character may act at time all other characters remain still with few exceptions that may involve use special abilities order which characters act usually dependent on their attributes such speed agility this system rewards strategic planning more than quickness also points fact that realism games means end immersion game world not end itself turn-based system makes possible for example run within range opponent kill him before he gets chance act duck out from behind hard cover fire retreat back without opponent being able fire which are course both impossibilities however tactical possibilities have been created by this unreality that did not exist before player determines whether loss immersion reality game worth satisfaction gained from development tactic its successful execution fallout has been praised being shining example good turn-based combat system real-time combat can import features from action games creating hybrid action rpg game genre but other rpg battle

famous rtwp engine infinity engine other names for real-time with pause include active pause semi real-time tactical rpg maker apeiron named their system smart pause mode spm because would

combat system traditionally used early role-playing games representations player characters monsters would move around arena modeled after surrounding terrain attacking any enemies that are sufficiently near interface graphics players typically navigate game world from first third-person perspective rpgs however isometric aerial top-down perspective common party-based rpgs order give player clear view their entire party their surroundings role-playing games require player manage large amount information frequently make use windowed interface for example spell-casting characters

writings by authors such j r r tolkien traditional strategy games such chess ancient epic literature dating back epic gilgamesh which followed same basic structure setting off various quests order accomplish goals after success role-playing video games such ultima wizardry which turn served blueprint for dragon quest final fantasy role-playing genre eventually diverged into two styles eastern role-playing games western role-playing games due cultural differences though roughly mirroring platform divide between consoles computers respectively finally while first rpgs offered strictly single player experience popularity multiplayer modes rose sharply during early mid-1990s with action role-playing games such secret mana diablo with advent internet multiplayer games have grown become massively multiplayer online role-playing games including lineage final fantasy xi world warcraft mainframe computers role-playing video game genre began mid-1970s offshoot early university mainframe

early crpgs were loose adaptations d&d they also included both first-person displays overhead views sometimes same game akalabeth for example used both perspectives most key features rpgs were developed this early period prior release ultima iii exodus one prime influences on both computer console rpg development for example wizardry featured menu-driven combat tunnels doom featured tactical combat on special combat screen dungeons daggorath featured real-time combat which took place on main dungeon map starting with questron mission crush ssi produced many series crpgs their game phantasie notable for introducing automapping in-game scrolls providing hints background information they also released pool radiance first several gold box crpgs based on advanced dungeons & dragons rules these games featured first-person display for movement combined with overhead tactical display for combat one common feature rpgs from this era which matt barton calls golden age computer rpgs use numbered paragraphs printed manual adjunct booklets containing games lengthier texts player could be directed read certain paragraph instead being shown text on screen ultimate exemplar this approach was sir-techs star saga trilogy which only two games were released first game contained textlets usually much longer than single paragraph spread across booklets while second contained paragraphs spread across booklets most games from this era were turn-based although dungeon master its imitators had real-time combat other classic titles from this era include bards tale wasteland start might magic 1986-2014 series continuing ultima 1981-1999 series later middle late 1990s isometric sprite-based rpgs became commonplace with video game publishers interplay

video games early 21st century western rpgs earliest rpg on console was dragonstomper on atari another early rpg on console was bokosuka wars originally released for sharp x1 computer later ported msx nes sharp x68000 new bokosuka wars game laid foundations for tactical role-playing game genre simulation rpg genre known japan was also early example real-time action role-playing game chunsoft created nes title dragon quest called dragon warrior north america until eighth game which drew inspiration from computer rpgs ultima wizardry regarded template for future japanese role-playing video games released since then genre came into its own with release several highly influential console rpgs distinguishing themselves from computer rpgs including genre-defining phantasy star released for master system shigeru miyamotos zelda ii adventure link for famicom disk system was one earliest action role-playing games combining action-adventure game framework its predecessor legend zelda with statistical elements turn-based rpgs most rpgs at this time were turn-based faxanadu was another early action rpg for nes released side-story computer action rpg dragon slayer ii xanadu squares final fantasy for nes introduced side-view battles with player characters on right enemies on left which soon became norm for numerous console rpgs dragon warrior iii introduced character progression system allowing player change partys character classes during course game another major innovation was introduction day/night cycles certain items characters quests are only accessible at certain times day phantasy star ii for genesis established many conventions genre including epic dramatic character-driven storyline dealing with serious themes subject matter strategy-based battle system console rpgs distinguished themselves from computer rpgs greater degree early 1990s console rpgs became more heavily story-based than their computer counterparts one major differences that emerged during this time was portrayal characters console rpgs often featured intricately related characters who had distinctive personalities traits with players assuming roles people who cared about each other fell love even had families romance particular was theme that was common most console rpgs at time but absent from most computer rpgs during 1990s console rpgs had become increasingly dominant exerting greater influence on computer rpgs than other way around console rpgs had eclipsed computer rpgs for some time though computer rpgs began making comeback towards end decade with interactive choice-filled adventures next major revolution came late 1990s which saw rise optical disks fifth generation consoles implications for rpgs were enormous—longer more involved quests better audio full-motion video this was first clearly demonstrated by phenomenal success final fantasy vii which considered one most influential games all time with record-breaking production budget around $45 million ambitious scope final fantasy vii raised possibilities for genre with its dozens minigames much higher production values latter includes innovations such use characters on pre-rendered backgrounds battles viewed from multiple different angles rather than single angle for first time full-motion cgi video seamlessly blended into gameplay effectively integrated throughout game game was soon ported pc gained much success there did several other originally console rpgs blurring line between console computer platforms cultural differences after success console role-playing games japan role-playing genre eventually began being classified into two fairly distinct styles computer rpg console rpg due stylistic gameplay and/or cultural reasons with latter having become popularized heavily influenced by early japanese video games such dragon quest final fantasy early 2000s however platform differences began blur computer rpgs console rpgs were eventually classified western role-playing games wrpgs japanese role-playing games jrpgs respectively though sharing fundamental premises western rpgs tend feature darker graphics older characters greater focus on roaming freedom realism underlying game mechanics eg rules-based system-based whereas eastern rpgs tend feature brighter anime -like graphics younger characters faster-paced gameplay greater focus on tightly-orchestrated linear storylines with intricate plots eg action-based story-based further western rpgs are more likely allow players create customize characters from scratch since late 1990s have had stronger focus on extensive dialog tree systems eg planescape torment on other hand japanese rpgs tend limit players developing pre-defined player characters often do not allow option create choose ones own playable characters make decisions that alter plot early 1990s japanese rpgs were seen being much closer fantasy novels but by late 1990s had become more cinematic style eg final fantasy series while at same time western rpgs started becoming more novelistic style eg planescape torment by late 2000s western rpgs had also adopted more cinematic style eg mass effect series one reason given for these differences that many early japanese console rpgs can be seen forms interactive manga japanese comics anime wrapped around western rule systems at time addition influence visual novel adventure games result japanese console rpgs differentiated themselves with stronger focus on scripted narratives character drama alongside streamlined gameplay recent years these trends have turn been adopted by western rpgs which have begun moving more towards tightly structured narratives addition moving away from numbers rules favor streamlined combat systems similar action games addition large number western independent games are modelled after japanese rpgs especially those 16-bit era partly due rpg maker game development tools example kawaii art cute art such this unpopular with some players another oft-cited difference prominence absence kawaisa cuteness japanese culture different approaches with respect character aesthetics western rpgs tend maintain serious gritty tone jrpg protagonsists tend be designed with emphasis on aesthetic beauty even male characters are often young androgynous shōnen bishōnen appearance jrpgs often have cute even comic-relief type characters animals juxtaposed clashing with more mature themes situations many modern jrpgs feature characters designed same style those manga anime stylistic differences are often due differing target audiences western rpgs are usually geared primarily towards teenage adult males whereas japanese rpgs are usually intended for much larger demographic including female audiences who for example accounted for nearly third final fantasy xiiis fanbase modern japanese rpgs are more likely feature turn-based battles while modern western rpgs are more likely feature real-time combat past reverse was often true real-time action role-playing games were far more common among japanese console rpgs than western computer rpgs up until late 1990s due gamepads usually being better suited real-time action than keyboard mouse there are course exceptions such final fantasy xii shin megami tensei devil summoner onwards two modern eastern rpgs that feature real-time combat temple elemental evil modern western rpg that features turn-based combat some journalists video game designers have questioned this cultural classification arguing that differences between eastern western games have been exaggerated interview held at american electronic entertainment expo japanese video game developer tetsuya nomura who worked on final fantasy kingdom hearts emphasized that rpgs should not be classified by country-of-origin but rather described simply for what they are role-playing games hironobu sakaguchi creator final fantasy last story noted that while users like categorise japanese rpgs turn-based traditional styles western rpgs born from first-person shooters there are titles that dont fit category pointing chrono trigger which he also worked on mana games he further noted that there have been other games similar style chrono trigger but that its probably because games werent localised didnt reach western audience xeno series director tetsuya takahashi reference xenoblade chronicles stated that i don’t know when exactly people started using term jrpg but if this game makes people rethink meaning this term i’ll be satisfied writer jeremy parish 1upcom states that xenoblade throws into high relief sheer artificiality gaming communitys obsession over differences between western japanese rpgs pointing out that does things that dont really fit into either genre gamers do love their boundaries barriers neat little rules i know but just because you cram something into little box doesnt mean belongs there nick doerr joystiq criticizes claim that japanese rpgs are too linear pointing out that non-linear japanese rpgs are not uncommon—for instance romancing saga series likewise rowan kaiser joystiq points out that linear western rpgs were common 1990s argues that many often mentioned differences between eastern western games are stereotypes that are generally not true never was pointing classic examples like lands lore betrayal at krondor that were more narrative-focused than typical western-style rpgs time ign noted interview with xenoblade chronicles xs development team that label jrpg most commonly used refer rpgs whose presentation mimics design sensibilities anime manga that its typically presentation character archetypes that signal this jrpg criticisms due cultural differences between western japanese variations role-playing games both have often been compared critiqued by those within video games industry press late 1980s when traditional american computer rpgs such ultima defender crown were ported consoles they received mixed reviews from console gamers they were not perceived by many players be exciting japanese imports lacked arcade action-adventure elements commonly found japanese console rpgs at time early 1990s american computer rpgs also began facing criticism for their plots where party sticks together through thick thin always act together group rather than individuals where non-player characters are one-dimensional characters comparison more fantasy novel approach squaresoft console rpgs such final fantasy iv however game designer sandy petersen noted that among computer gamers there was criticism against cartridge-based console jrpgs being not role-playing at all due popular examples such secret mana especially legend zelda using direct arcade-style action combat systems instead more abstract turn-based battle systems associated with computer rpgs response he pointed out that not all console rpgs are action-based pointing final fantasy lufia another early criticism dating back phantasy star games late 1980s was frequent use defined player characters contrast wizardry gold box games where players avatars such knights clerics thieves were blank slates japanese console rpgs became increasingly more dominant 1990s became known for being more heavily story character-based american computer rpgs began face criticism for having characters devoid personality background due representing avatars which player uses interact with world contrast japanese console rpgs which depicted characters with distinctive personalities american computer rpgs were thus criticized for lacking more traditional role-playing offered by japanese console rpgs which instead emphasized character interactions response north american computer rpgs began making comeback towards end 1990s with interactive choice-filled adventures more recent years several writers have criticized jrpgs not being true rpgs for heavy usage scripted cutscenes dialogue frequent lack branching outcomes japanese rpgs are also sometimes criticized for having relatively simple battle systems which players are able win by repetitively mashing buttons result japanese-style role-playing games are held disdain by some western gamers leading term jrpg being held pejorative some observers have also speculated that japanese rpgs are stagnating declining both quality popularity including remarks by bioware co-founder greg zeschuk writing director daniel erickson that jrpgs are stagnating—and that final fantasy xiii not even really rpg criticisms regarding seemingly nebulous justifications by some japanese designers for newly changed alternately newly un-changed features recent titles calls among some gaming journalists fix jrpgs problems well claims that some recent titles such front mission evolved are beginning attempt—and failing to—imitate western titles article for psm3 brittany vincent rpgfancom felt that developers have mired modern jrpg unoriginality citing square enix ceo yoichi wada who stated that they’re strictly catering particular audience article noting difference game sales between japan north america before going on suggest jrpgs may need move forward this criticism has also occurred wider media with advertisement for fallout new vegas obsidian entertainment japan openly mocked japanese rpgs traditional characteristics favor their own title nick doerr joystiq noted that bethesda felt that japanese rpgs are all same too linear which he responded that most part its true but noted there are also non-linear japanese rpgs such romancing saga series such criticisms have produced responses such ones by japanese video game developers shinji mikami yuji horii effect that jrpgs were never popular west begin with that western reviewers are biased against turn-based systems jeff fleming gamasutra also states that japanese rpgs on home consoles are generally showing signs staleness but notes that handheld consoles such nintendo ds have had more original experimental japanese rpgs released recent years western rpgs have also received criticism recent years they remain less popular japan where until recently western games general had negative reputation japan where vast majority early console role-playing video games originate western rpgs remain largely unknown developer motomu toriyama criticized western rpgs stating that they dump you big open world let you do whatever you like difficult tell compelling story hironobu sakaguchi noted that users like categorise western rpgs sort different style born from first person shooters recent years some have also criticized western rpgs for becoming less rpg-like instead with further emphasis on action christian nutt gamespy states that contrast japanese rpgs western rpgs greater control over development customization playable characters has come at expense plot gameplay resulting what he felt was generic dialogue lack character development within narrative weaker battle systems he also states that western rpgs tend focus more on underlying rules governing battle system rather than on experience itself tom battey edge magazine noted that problems often cited against japanese rpgs mentioned above also often apply many western rpgs well games outside rpg genre bioware games have been criticized for lack innovation repetitive structure lack real choice western rpgs such bethesda games have also been criticized for lacking narrative strength mechanical intricacy due open-ended sandbox structure their games despite criticisms leveled at both variations rowan kaiser joystiq argued that many often mentioned differences between eastern western games are stereotypes that are generally not true noting various similarities between several western titles such lands lore betrayal at krondor dragon age several classic eastern titles such final fantasy phantasy star noting that both these western japanese titles share similar emphasis on linear storytelling pre-defined characters bright-colored graphics developer hironobu sakaguchi also noted there are many games from both that dont fit such categorizations such his own chrono trigger well mana games noting there have been many other such japanese role-playing games that never released western markets controversy what viewed largely secular nature japanese culture has resulted heavy usage themes symbols characters taken from variety religions including christianity japanese shinto this tends be problematic when jrpgs are exported western countries where topics religion blasphemy remain sensitive such united states not unusual for jrpg exhibit elements that would be controversial west such xenogears final fantasy tactics featuring antagonists that bear similarities abrahamic god catholic church respectively nintendo has made efforts past remove references such these prior introducing their games into north american market relationship other genres rpgs seldom test players physical skill combat typically tactical challenge rather than physical one games involve other non-action gameplay such choosing dialog options inventory management buying selling items although rpgs share some combat rules with wargames rpgs are often about small group individual characters wargames tend have large groups identical units well non-humanoid units such tanks airplanes role-playing games do not normally allow player produce more units however heroes might magic series crosses these genres by combining individual heroes with large amounts troops large battles rpgs rival adventure games terms their rich storylines contrast genres that do not rely upon storytelling such sports games puzzle games both genres also feature highly detailed characters great deal exploration however adventure games usually have well-defined character whereas while rpgs may do so many allow player design their characters adventure games usually focus on one character whereas rpgs often feature entire party rpgs also feature combat system which adventure games usually lack whereas both adventure games rpgs may focus on personal psychological growth characters rpgs tend emphasize complex eternal economy where characters are defined by increasing numerical attributes gameplay elements strongly associated with this genre such statistical character development have been widely adapted other video game genres for example grand theft auto san andreas action-adventure game uses resource statistics abbreviated stats define wide range attributes including stamina weapon proficiency driving lung capacity muscle tone uses numerous cutscenes quests advance story warcraft iii reign chaos real-time strategy game features heroes that can complete quests obtain new equipment learn new abilities they advance level according satoru iwata former president nintendo turn-based rpgs have been unfairly criticized being outdated action-based rpgs can frustrate players who are unable keep up with battles according yuji horii creator popular dragon quest series ryutaro ichimura producer square enix turn-based rpgs allow player time make decisions without feeling rushed worry about real-life distractions roguelikes main article roguelike interface original rogue looked on ascii computer terminal roguelike subgenre role-playing video games characterized by procedural generation game levels turn-based gameplay tile-based graphics permanent death player-character typically based on high fantasy narrative setting roguelikes descend from game rogue particularly mirroring rogues character- sprite-based graphics some factors used this definition include these games were popularized among college students computer programmers 1980s 1990s leading large number variants but adhering these common gameplay elements some more well-known variants include hack nethack ancient domains mystery moria angband tales majeyal japanese series mystery dungeon games by chunsoft inspired by rogue also fall within concept roguelike games more recently with more powerful home computers gaming systems new variations roguelikes incorporating other gameplay genres thematic elements graphical styles have become popular typically retaining notion procedural generation these titles are sometimes labeled roguelike-like rogue-lite procedural death labyrinths reflect variation from titles which mimic gameplay traditional roguelikes more faithfully other games like diablo unreal world took inspiration from roguelikes action rpgs main article action role-playing game play media video showing basic gameplay point-and-click action rpgs typically action rpgs feature each player directly controlling single character real time feature strong focus on combat action with plot character interaction kept minimum early action rpgs tended follow template set by 1980s nihon falcom titles such dragon slayer ys series which feature hack slash combat where player characters movements actions are controlled directly using keyboard game controller rather than using menus this formula was refined by action-adventure game legend zelda which set template used by many subsequent action rpgs including innovations such open world nonlinear gameplay battery backup saving attack button that animates sword swing projectile attack on screen game was largely responsible for surge action-oriented rpgs released since late 1980s both japan north america legend zelda series would continue exert influence on transition both console computer rpgs from stat-heavy turn-based combat towards real-time action combat following decades different variation action rpg formula was popularized by diablo where majority commands—such moving attacking—are executed using mouse clicks rather than via menus though learned spells can also be assigned hotkeys many action rpgs non-player characters serve only one purpose be buy sell items upgrade players abilities issue them with combat-centric quests problems players face also often have action-based solution such breaking wooden door open with axe rather than finding key needed unlock though some games place greater emphasis on character attributes such lockpicking skill puzzle-solving one common challenge developing action rpgs including content beyond that killing enemies with sheer number items locations monsters found many such games can be difficult create needed depth offer players unique experience tailored his her beliefs choices actions this doubly true if game makes use randomization common one notable example game which went beyond this deus ex which offered multiple solutions problems using intricately layered story options individually constructed environments instead simply bashing their way through levels players were challenged act character by choosing dialog options appropriately by using surrounding environment intelligently this produced experience that was unique tailored each situation opposed one that repeated itself endlessly at one time action rpgs were much more common on consoles than on computers though there had been attempts at creating action-oriented computer rpgs during late 1980s early 1990s often vein zelda very few saw any success with game ultima vii being one more successful exceptions north america on pc diablos effect on market was significant had many imitators its style combat went on be used by many games that came after for many years afterwards games that closely mimicked diablo formula were referred diablo clones three four titles series were still sold together part diablo battle chest over decade after diablos release other examples action rpgs for pc include dungeon siege sacred torchlight hellgate london—the last which was developed by team headed by former blizzard employees some whom had participated creation diablo series like diablo rogue before torchlight hellgate london made use procedural generation generate game levels also included within this subgenre are role-playing shooters—games that incorporate elements role-playing games shooter games including first-person third-person recent examples include mass effect series borderlands 3rd birthday tactical rpgs main article tactical role-playing game this subgenre role-playing game principally refers games which incorporate elements from strategy games alternative traditional role-playing game rpg systems tactical rpgs are descendents traditional strategy games such chess table-top role-playing strategic war games such chainmail which were mainly tactical their original form format tactical crpg also like traditional rpg its appearance pacing rule structure like standard rpgs player controls finite party battles similar number enemies like other rpgs death usually temporary but this genre incorporates strategic gameplay such tactical movement on isometric grid tactical rpgs tend not feature multiplayer play number early western role-playing video games used highly tactical form combat including parts ultima series which introduced party-based tiled combat ultima iii exodus ultima iii would go on be ported many other platforms influence development later titles would bokosuka wars considered pioneer strategy/simulation rpg genre according nintendo conventionally however term tactical rpg known simulation rpg japan refers distinct subgenre that was born japan early origins tactical rpgs are difficult trace from american side pacific where much early rpg genre developed many tactical rpgs can be both extremely time-consuming extremely difficult hence appeal most tactical rpgs hardcore not casual computer video game player traditionally tactical rpgs have been quite popular japan but have not enjoyed same degree success north america elsewhere however audience for japanese tactical rpgs has grown substantially since mid-90s with ps1 ps2 titles such final fantasy tactics suikoden tactics vanguard bandits disgaea enjoying surprising measure popularity well hand-held war games like fire emblem final fantasy tactics for ps1 often considered breakthrough title outside japan older trpgs are also being re-released via software emulation—such on wii virtual console—and on handheld game consoles giving games new lease on life exposure new audiences japanese video games such these are result no longer nearly rare commodity north america they were during 1990s western video games have utilized similar mechanics for years well were largely defined by x-com ufo defense much same way eastern video games were by fire emblem titles such x-com have generally allowed greater freedom movement when interacting with surrounding environment than their eastern counterparts other similar examples include jagged alliance 1994–2013 silent storm 2003–2005 series according few developers became increasingly difficult during 2000s develop games this type for pc west though several had been developed eastern europe with mixed results even some japanese console rpg developers began complain about bias against turn-based systems reasons cited include western publishers focus on developing real-time action-oriented games instead lastly there are number full-fledged crpgs which could be described having tactical combat examples from classic era crpgs include parts aforementioned ultima series ssis wizards crown eternal dagger gold box games late 80s early 90s many which were later ported japanese video game systems realms arkania 1992-1996 series based on german dark eye pen-and-paper system more recent examples include wasteland shadowrun dragonfall divinity original sin —all released partly due release these games has been called crpg renaissance mmorpgs further information mud history massively multiplayer online games though many original rpgs for plato mainframe system late 1970s also supported multiple simultaneous players popularity multiplayer modes mainstream rpgs did not begin rise sharply until early mid-1990s for instance secret mana early action role-playing game by square was one first commercial rpgs feature cooperative multiplayer gameplay offering two-player three-player action once main character had acquired his party members later diablo would combine crpg action game elements with internet multiplayer mode that allowed up four players enter same world fight monsters trade items fight against each other multiple people chat play online mmorpg daimonin also during this time period mud genre that had been spawned by mud1 was undergoing tremendous expansion phase due release spread lpmud dikumud soon driven by mainstream adoption internet these parallel trends merged popularization graphical muds which would soon become known massively multiplayer online role-playing games mmorpgs beginning with games like meridian nexus kingdom winds ultima online lineage everquest leading modern phenomena such runescape final fantasy xi eve online world warcraft though superficially similar mmorpgs lend their appeal more socializing influences being online with hundreds even thousands other players at time trace their origins more from muds than from crpgs like ultima wizardry rather than focusing on old school considerations memorizing huge numbers stats esoterica battling out complex tactical environments players instead spend much their time forming maintaining guilds clans distinction between crpgs mmorpgs muds can result be very sharp likenable difference between attending renaissance fair reading good fantasy novel further mmorpgs have been criticized for diluting epic feeling single-player rpgs related media among thousands concurrent adventurers stated simply every player wants be hero slay monster rescue princess obtain magic sword but when there are thousands players all playing same game clearly not everyone can be hero this problem became obvious some game everquest where groups players would compete sometimes harass each other order get monsters same dungeon drop valuable items leading several undesirable behaviors such kill stealing spawn camping ninja looting response—for instance by richard garriott tabula rasa—developers began turning instance dungeons means reducing competition over limited resources well preserving gaming experience—though this mechanic has its own set detractors single-player games are great i love them they have great feature your life very special you are hero you get save whole world like disney world you can go shops get food but when you get on boat for pirate ride youre your own version reality once ride starts you are blissfully unaware boats front you behind you —richard garriott regarding use instancing tabula rasa lastly there exist markets such korea china that while saturated with mmorpgs have so far proved relatively unreceptive single-player rpgs for instance internet-connected personal computers are relatively common korea when compared other regions—particularly numerous pc bangs scattered around country where patrons are able pay play multiplayer video games—possibly due historical bans on japanese imports well culture that traditionally sees video games frivolous toys computers educational result some wonder whether stand-alone single-player rpg still viable commercially—especially on personal computer—when there are competing pressures such big-name publishers marketing needs video game piracy change culture competitive price-point-to-processing-power ratio at least initially modern console systems hybrid genres finally steadily increasing number other non-rp video games have adopted aspects traditionally seen rpgs such experience point systems equipment management choices dialogue developers push fill demand for role-playing elements non-rpgs blending these elements with number different game engines gameplay styles have created myriad hybrid game categories formed by mixing popular gameplay elements featured other genres such first-person shooters platformers turn-based real-time strategy games examples include first-person shooters such parts deus ex starting stalker starting series real-time strategy games such spellforce order dawn warhammer dawn war ii puzzle video games such castlevania puzzle puzzle quest challenge warlords turn-based strategy games like steel panthers 1995–2006 series which combined tactical military combat with rpg-derived unit advancement group hybrid games have been

jacquard head that adapts great many dobby looms that allow weaving machine then create intricate patterns often seen jacquard weaving jacquard looms whilst relatively common textile industry are not ubiquitous dobby looms which are usually faster much cheaper operate however unlike jacquard looms they are not capable producing so many different weaves from one warp modern jacquard looms are controlled by computers place original punched cards can have thousands hooks threading jacquard loom so labor-intensive that many looms are threaded only once subsequent warps are then tied existing warp with help knotting robot which ties each new thread on individually even for small loom with only few thousand warp ends process re-threading can take days 19th century jacquard loom importance computing jacquard head used replaceable punched cards control sequence operations considered important step history computing hardware ability change pattern looms weave by simply changing cards was important conceptual precursor development computer programming data entry charles babbage knew jacquard looms planned use cards store programs his analytical engine late 19th century herman hollerith took idea using punched cards store information step further when he created punched card tabulating machine which he used input data for us census large punched-card-based data processing industry developed first half twentieth century dominated by international business machine corporation ibm with its line unit record equipment cards were used for data however with programming done by plugboards some early computers such ibm automatic sequence controlled calculator harvard mark i received program instructions from paper tape punched with holes similar jacquards string cards later

alhazen discovered sum formula for fourth power using method that could be generally used determine sum for any integral power he used this find volume paraboloid he could find integral formula for any polynomial without having developed general formula science main article islamic science has been suggested that this section be split out into another article titled islamic science discuss november see also list inventions medieval islamic world scientific method ibn al-haytham alhazen was significant figure history scientific method particularly his approach experimentation has been described worlds first true scientist avicenna made rules for testing effectiveness drugs including that effect produced by experimental drug should be seen constantly after many repetitions be counted physician rhazes was early proponent experimental medicine recommended using control for clinical research he said if you want study effect bloodletting on condition divide patients into two groups perform bloodletting only on one group watch both compare results jim al-khalili gives example classification materials sign new ways thinking while classification material world by ancient indians greeks into air earth fire water was more philosophical medieval islamic scientists used practical experimental observation classify materials rhazes for example classified minerals into six

al-nafis his commentary on anatomy avicennas canon was first contradict contention galen school that blood could pass between ventricles heart through cardiac inter-ventricular septum that separates them saying that there no passage between ventricles at this point instead he correctly argued that all blood that reached left ventricle did so after passing through lung he also stated that there

putrefied most slowly for islamic scholars indian greek physicians medical researchers sushruta galen mankah atreya hippocrates charaka agnivesa were pre-eminent authorities order make indian greek tradition more accessible understandable teachable islamic scholars ordered made more systematic vast indian greco-roman medical knowledge by writing encyclopedias summaries sometimes past scholars were criticized like rhazes who criticized refuted galens revered theories most notably theory humors was thus accused ignorance was through 12th-century arabic translations that medieval europe rediscovered hellenic medicine including works galen hippocrates discovered ancient indian medicine including works sushruta charaka works such avicennas canon medicine were translated into latin

hospitals were built most major cities hospitals were typically run by three-man board comprising non-medical administrator physician who served mutwalli dean shaykh saydalani chief pharmacist who oversaw dispensary by ninth century there was rapid expansion private pharmacies many muslim cities initially these were unregulated managed by personnel inconsistent quality decrees by caliphs al-mamun al-mutasim required examinations license pharmacists pharmacy students were trained combination classroom exercises coupled with day-to-day practical experiences with drugs avoid conflicts interest doctors were banned from owning sharing ownership pharmacy pharmacies were periodically inspected by government inspectors called muhtasib who checked see that medicines were mixed properly not diluted kept clean jars violators were fined beaten medical facilities traditionally closed each night but by 10th century laws were passed keep hospitals open hours day hospitals were forbidden turn away patients who were unable pay eventually charitable foundations called waqfs were formed support hospitals well schools this money supported free medical care for all citizens notable example

opponents reduction enemy forces usually goal victory achieved through superior planning element chance takes smaller role most strategy video games player given godlike view game world indirectly controls game units under their command thus most strategy games involve elements warfare varying degrees feature combination tactical strategic considerations addition combat these games often challenge players ability explore manage economy relationship other genres even though there are many action games that involve strategic thinking they are seldom classified strategy games strategy game typically larger scope their main emphasis on players ability outthink their opponent strategy games rarely involve physical challenge tend annoy strategically minded players when they do compared other genres such action adventure games where one player takes on many enemies strategy games usually involve some level symmetry between sides each side generally has access similar resources actions with strengths weaknesses each side being generally balanced although strategy games involve strategic tactical sometimes logistical challenges they are distinct from puzzle games strategy game calls for planning around conflict between players whereas puzzle games call for planning isolation strategy games are also distinct from construction management simulations which include economic challenges without any fighting these games may incorporate some amount conflict but are different from strategy games because they do not emphasize need for direct action upon opponent although strategy games are similar role-playing video games that player must manage units with variety numeric attributes rpgs tend be about smaller number unique characters while strategy games focus on larger numbers fairly similar units game design units conflict strategy games give players indirect control over many units battlefield many games for example globulation include other challenges such building construction conflict strategy games takes place between groups singular combatants usually called units games vary how many types units player can use but each unit has specific strengths weaknesses units vary their movement speed well amount health damage they can withstand units may also have different levels attack strength range although units are typically used for combat they may also be used for other purposes such transport scouting units that cannot move such fixed turrets are often still treated units if unit destroyed player loses benefit that unit most strategy games allow players construct new units buildings factories player commands their forces by selecting unit usually by clicking with mouse issuing order from menu keyboard shortcuts become important for advanced players units can typically move attack stop hold position although other strategy games offer more complex orders units may even have specialized abilities such ability become invisible other units usually balanced with abilities that detect otherwise invisible things some strategy games even offer special leader units that provide bonus other units units may also have ability sail fly over otherwise impassable terrain provide transport for other units non-combat abilities often include ability repair construct other units buildings even imaginary fantastic conflicts strategy games try reproduce important tactical situations throughout history techniques such flanking making diversions cutting supply lines may become integral parts managing combat terrain becomes important part strategy since units may gain lose advantages based on landscape some strategy games such civilization iii medieval total war involve other forms conflict such diplomacy espionage however warfare most common form conflict game designers have found difficult make non-violent forms conflict appealing economy resources upgrades strategy games often involve other economic challenges these can include building construction population maintenance resource management strategy games frequently make use windowed interface manage these complex challenges most strategy games allow players accumulate resources which can be converted units converted buildings such factories that produce more units quantity types resources vary from game game some games will emphasize resource acquisition by scattering large quantities throughout map while other games will put more emphasis on how resources are managed applied by balancing availability resources between players lesser extent some strategy games give players fixed quantity units at start game strategy games often allow player spend resources on upgrades research some these upgrades enhance players entire economy other upgrades apply unit class units unlock enhance certain combat abilities sometimes enhancements are enabled by building structure that enables more advanced structures games with large number upgrades often feature technology tree which series advancements that players can research unlock new units buildings other capabilities technology trees are quite large some games 4x strategy games are known for having largest build order linear pattern production research resource management aimed at achieving specific specialized goal they are analogous chess openings that player will have specific order play mind however amount build order strategy around which build order built even which build order then used varies on skill ability other factors such how aggressive defensive each player map exploration early strategy games featured top-down perspective similar nature board game paper map many later games adopted isometric perspective even with rise graphics potential manipulate camera games usually feature some kind aerial view very rarely do strategy games show world from perspective from avatar on ground this provide player with big picture view game world form more effective strategies exploration key element most strategy games landscape often shrouded darkness this darkness lifted players units enters area ability explore may be inhibited by different kinds terrain such hills water other obstructions even after area explored that area may become dim if player does not patrol this design technique called fog war where player can see terrain but not units within explored area this makes possible for enemies attack unexpectedly from otherwise explored areas real-time versus turn-based bos wars real-time strategy game where events unfold continuously strategy video games are categorized based on whether they offer continuous gameplay real-time strategy discrete phases turn-based strategy these differences time-keeping lead several other differences typically turn-based strategy games have stronger artificial intelligence than real-time strategy games since turn-based pace allows more time for complex calculations but real-time artificial intelligence makes up for this disadvantage with its ability manage multiple units more quickly than human overall real-time strategy games are more action-oriented opposed abstract planning emphasized turn-based strategy relative popularity real-time strategy has led some critics conclude that more gamers prefer action-oriented games fans real-time strategy have criticized wait times associated with turn-based games praised challenge realism associated with making quick decisions real-time contrast turn-based strategy fans have criticized real-time strategy games because most units do not behave appropriately without orders thus turn-based pace allows players input more realistic detailed plans game theorists have noted that strategic thinking does not lend itself well real-time action turn-based strategy purists have criticized real-time strategy games for replacing true strategy with gameplay that rewards rapid mouse-clicking overall reviewers have been able recognize advantages associated with both main types strategy games strategy versus tactics most strategy video games involve mix both strategy tactics tactics usually refer how troops are utilized given battle whereas strategy describes mix troops location battle commanders larger goals military doctrine however there also growing subgenre purely tactical games which are referred real-time tactics turn-based tactics game reviewers scholars sometimes debate whether they are using terminology such tactics strategy appropriately chris taylor designer total annihilation supreme commander has gone so far suggest that real-time strategy titles are more about tactics than strategy but releases that are considered pure tactical games usually provide players with fixed set units downplay other strategic considerations such manufacturing resource management tactical games are strictly about combat typically focus on individual battles other small sections larger conflict settings themes strategy games can take place number settings depending on theatre warfare releases may be noted naval strategy games space strategy games title may be noted for its grand strategic scale whether game real-time turn-based strategy games also draw on number historical periods including world war ii medieval era napoleonic era some strategy games are even based alternate history by manipulating rewriting certain historical facts also common see games based science fiction futuristic settings well fantasy settings some strategy games are abstract do not try represent world with high fidelity although many these may still involve combat sense that units can capture destroy each other these games sometimes offer non-combat challenges such arranging units specific patterns however vast majority computerized strategy games are representational with more complex game mechanics single player multiplayer massively multiplayer strategy games include single-player gameplay multiplayer gameplay both single player games will sometimes feature campaign mode which involves series matches against several artificial intelligence opponents finishing each match mission will advance games plot often with cut scenes some games will reward completed mission with new abilities upgrades hardcore strategy gamers tend prefer multiplayer competition where human opponents provide more challenging competition than artificial intelligence artificial intelligence opponents often need hidden information bonuses provide challenge players more recently massively multiplayer online strategy games have appeared such shattered galaxy from however these games are relatively difficult design implement compared other massively multiplayer online games numerous player-controlled units create larger volume online data by reviewers expressed disappointment with titles produced thus far critics argued that strategy games are not conducive massively multiplayer gameplay single victory cannot have much impact large persistent world this makes hard for player care about small victory especially if they are fighting for faction that losing overall war however more recent developers

designed be never-ending nevertheless some games are attempting crack code so-to-speak true real-time strategy mmog one method by which they are doing so by making defenses stronger than weapons thereby slowing down combat considerably making possible for players more carefully consider their actions during confrontation customizable units are another way adding strategic elements long players are truly able influence capabilities their units industry seeking present new candidates worthy being known for thought strategy rather than dexterity strategy while herzog zwei regarded first true rts game defining title for genre was westwood studioss dune ii which was followed by their seminal command & conquer games cavedogs total annihilation blizzards warcraft series starcraft series ensemble studios age empires series are some most popular rts games addition online games such nukezone can be considered belonging this genre well real-time tactics rtt main article real-time tactics real-time tactics abbreviated rtt less commonly referred fixed-unit real-time strategy subgenre tactical wargames played real-time simulating considerations circumstances operational warfare military tactics also sometimes considered subgenre real-time strategy thus may this context exist element gameplay basis for whole game differentiated from real-time strategy gameplay by lack resource micromanagement base unit building well greater importance individual units focus on complex battlefield tactics example titles include warhammer dark omen world conflict close combat series early tactical role-playing games such bokosuka wars silver ghost first queen mmorts main article massively multiplayer online real-time strategy game massively multiplayer online real-time strategy games also known mmorts combine real-time strategy rts with persistent world players often assume role general king other type figurehead leading army into battle while maintaining resources needed for such warfare titles are often based sci-fi fantasy universe are distinguished from single small-scale multiplayer rts games by number players common use persistent world generally hosted by games publisher which continues evolve even when player offline multiplayer online battle arena moba main article multiplayer online battle arena vainglory multiplayer online battle arena game designed for smartphones tablets multiplayer online battle arena moba also known action real-time strategy arts genre strategy video games that originated subgenre real-time strategy which player controls single character one two teams objective destroy opposing teams main structure with assistance periodically spawned computer-controlled units that march forward along set paths player characters typically have various abilities advantages that improve over course game that contribute teams overall strategy fusion action games role-playing games real-time strategy games players usually do not construct either buildings units genre traces its roots aeon strife custom map for starcraft where four players each controlling single powerful unit aided by weak computer-controlled units were put against stronger computer-controlled faction defense ancients dota map based on aeon strife for warcraft iii reign chaos frozen throne was one first major titles its genre first moba for which has been held sponsored tournaments was followed by two spiritual successors league legends heroes newerth eventually sequel dota well numerous other games genre tower defense main article tower defense tower defense games have very simple layout usually computer-controlled monsters called creeps move along set path player must place build towers along this path kill creeps some games towers are placed along set path for creeps while others towers can interrupt creep movement change their path most tower defense games different towers have different abilities such poisoning enemies slowing them down player awarded money for killing creeps this money can be used buy more towers buy upgrades for tower such increased power range turn-based strategy tbs main article turn-based strategy battle for wesnoth turn-based strategy game term turn-based strategy tbs usually reserved for certain computer strategy games distinguish them from real-time computer strategy games player turn-based game allowed period analysis before committing game action examples this genre are civilization heroes might magic making history advance wars master orion atwar tbs games come two flavors differentiated by whether players make their plays simultaneously take turns former types games are called simultaneously executed tbs games with diplomacy notable example latter games fall into player-alternated tbs games category are subsequently subdivided into ranked b round-robin start c random difference being order under which players take their turns with ranked players take their turns same order every time with b first player selected according round-robin policy with c random first player course randomly selected almost all non-computer strategy games are turn-based however personal computer game market trend has lately inclined more towards real-time games some recent games feature mix both real-time turn-based elements thrown together turn-based tactics tbt main article turn-based tactics turn-based tactics tbt tactical turn-based ttb genre strategy video games that through stop-action simulates considerations circumstances operational warfare military tactics generally small-scale confrontations opposed more strategic considerations turn-based strategy tbs games turn-based tactical gameplay characterized by expectation players complete their tasks using only combat forces provided them usually by provision realistic at least believable representation military tactics operations examples this genre include wars jagged alliance x-com series well tactical

be described modern terms turing-complete machine was about century ahead its time all parts for his machine had be made by hand — this was major problem for device with thousands parts eventually project was dissolved with decision british government cease funding babbages failure complete analytical engine can be chiefly attributed difficulties not only politics financing but also his desire develop increasingly sophisticated computer move ahead faster than anyone else could follow nevertheless his son henry babbage completed simplified version analytical engines computing unit mill he gave successful demonstration its use computing tables analog computers sir william thomsons third tide-predicting machine design 1879–81 during first half 20th century many scientific computing needs

obsolescence became obvious by 1950s success digital electronic computers had spelled end for most analog computing machines but analog computers remained use during 1950s some specialized applications such education control systems aircraft slide rule digital computers electromechanical by united states navy had developed electromechanical analog computer small enough use aboard submarine this was torpedo data computer which used trigonometry solve problem firing torpedo at moving target during world war ii similar devices were developed other countries well replica zuses z3 first fully automatic digital electromechanical computer early digital computers were electromechanical electric switches drove mechanical relays perform calculation these devices had low operating speed were eventually superseded by much faster all-electric computers originally using vacuum tubes z2 created by german engineer konrad zuse was one earliest examples electromechanical relay computer zuse followed his earlier machine up with z3 worlds first working electromechanical programmable fully automatic digital computer z3 was built with relays implementing bit word length that operated at clock frequency about 5–10 hz program code was supplied on punched film while data could be stored words memory supplied from keyboard was quite similar modern machines some respects pioneering numerous advances such floating point numbers rather than harder-to-implement decimal system used charles babbages earlier design using binary system meant that zuses machines were easier build potentially more reliable given technologies available at that time z3 was turing complete vacuum tubes digital electronic circuits purely electronic circuit elements soon replaced their mechanical electromechanical equivalents at same time that digital calculation replaced analog engineer tommy flowers working at post office research station london 1930s began explore possible use

concept modern computer principle modern computer was proposed by alan turing his seminal paper on computable numbers turing proposed simple device that he called universal computing machine that now known universal turing machine he proved that such machine capable computing anything that computable by executing instructions program stored on tape allowing machine be programmable fundamental concept turings design stored program where all instructions for computing are stored memory von neumann acknowledged that central concept modern computer was due this paper turing machines are this day central object study theory computation except for limitations imposed by their finite memory stores modern computers are said be turing-complete which say they have algorithm execution capability equivalent universal turing machine stored programs section manchester small-scale experimental machine first stored-program computer early computing machines had fixed programs changing its function required re-wiring re-structuring machine with proposal stored-program computer this changed stored-program computer includes by design instruction set can store memory set instructions program that details computation theoretical basis for stored-program computer was laid by alan turing his paper turing joined national physical laboratory began work on developing electronic stored-program digital computer his report proposed electronic calculator was first specification for such device john von neumann at university pennsylvania also circulated his first draft report on edvac ferranti mark c manchester small-scale experimental machine nicknamed baby was worlds first stored-program computer was built at victoria university manchester by frederic c williams tom kilburn geoff tootill

mark mark turn quickly became prototype for ferranti mark worlds first commercially available general-purpose computer built by ferranti was delivered university manchester february at least seven these later machines were delivered between one them shell labs amsterdam october directors british catering company j lyons & company decided take active role promoting commercial development computers leo i computer became operational april ran worlds first regular routine office computer job transistors bipolar junction transistor bipolar transistor was invented from onwards transistors replaced vacuum tubes computer designs giving rise second generation computers compared vacuum tubes transistors have many advantages they are smaller require less power than vacuum tubes so give off less heat silicon junction transistors were much more reliable than vacuum tubes had longer indefinite service life transistorized computers could contain tens thousands binary logic circuits relatively compact space at university manchester team under leadership tom kilburn designed built machine using newly developed transistors instead valves their first transistorised computer first world was operational by second version was completed there april however machine did make use valves generate its khz clock waveforms circuitry read write on its magnetic drum memory so was not first completely transistorized computer that distinction goes harwell cadet built by electronics division atomic energy research establishment at harwell integrated circuits next great advance computing power came with advent integrated circuit idea integrated circuit was first conceived by radar scientist working for royal radar establishment ministry defence geoffrey wa dummer dummer presented first public description integrated circuit at symposium on progress quality electronic components washington dc on may first practical ics were invented by jack kilby at texas instruments robert noyce at fairchild semiconductor kilby recorded his initial ideas concerning integrated circuit july successfully demonstrating first working integrated example on september his patent application february kilby described his new device body semiconductor material wherein all components electronic circuit are completely integrated noyce also came up with his own idea integrated circuit half year later than kilby his chip solved many practical problems that kilbys had not produced at fairchild semiconductor was made silicon whereas kilbys chip was made germanium this new development heralded explosion commercial personal use computers led invention microprocessor while subject exactly which device was first microprocessor contentious partly due lack agreement on exact definition term microprocessor largely undisputed that first single-chip microprocessor was intel designed realized by ted hoff federico faggin stanley mazor at intel mobile computers become dominant with continued miniaturization computing resources advancements portable battery life portable computers grew popularity 2000s same developments that spurred growth laptop computers other portable computers allowed manufacturers integrate computing resources into cellular phones these so-called smartphones tablets run on variety operating systems have become dominant computing device on market with manufacturers reporting having shipped estimated million devices 2q programs defining feature modern computers which distinguishes them from all other machines that they can be programmed that say that some type instructions program can be given computer will process them modern computers based on von neumann architecture often have machine code form imperative programming language practical terms computer program may be just few instructions extend many millions instructions do programs for word processors web browsers for example typical modern computer can execute billions instructions per second gigaflops rarely makes mistake over many years operation large computer programs consisting several million instructions may take teams programmers years write due complexity task almost certainly contain errors stored program architecture main articles computer program computer programming replica small-scale experimental machine ssem worlds first stored-program computer at museum science industry manchester england this section applies most common ram machine-based computers most cases computer instructions are simple add one number another move some data from one location another send message some external device etc these instructions are read from computers memory are generally carried out executed order they were given however there are usually specialized instructions tell computer jump ahead backwards some other place program carry on executing from there these are called jump instructions branches furthermore jump instructions may be made happen conditionally so that different sequences instructions may be used depending on result some previous calculation some external event many computers directly support subroutines by providing type jump that remembers location jumped from another instruction return instruction following that jump instruction program execution might be likened reading book while person will normally read each word line sequence they may at times jump back earlier place text skip sections that are not interest similarly computer may sometimes go back repeat instructions some section program over over again until some internal condition met this called flow control within program what allows computer perform tasks repeatedly without human intervention comparatively person using pocket calculator can perform basic arithmetic operation such adding two numbers with just few button presses but add together all numbers from would take thousands button presses lot time with near certainty making mistake on other hand computer may be programmed do this with just few simple instructions following example written mips assembly language begin addi $8 $0 initialize sum addi $9 $0 set first number add = loop slti $10 $9 check if number less than beq $10 $0 finish if odd number greater than n then exit add $8 $8 $9 update sum addi $9 $9 get next number j loop repeat summing process finish add $2 $8 $0 put sum output register once told run this program computer will perform repetitive addition task without further human intervention will almost never make mistake modern pc can complete task fraction second machine code most computers individual instructions are stored machine code with each instruction being given unique number its operation code opcode for short command add two numbers together would have one opcode command multiply them would have different opcode so on simplest computers are able perform any handful different instructions more complex computers have several hundred choose from each with unique numerical code since computers memory able store numbers can also store instruction codes this leads important fact that entire programs which are just lists these instructions can be represented lists numbers can themselves be manipulated inside computer same way numeric data fundamental concept storing programs computers memory alongside data they operate on crux von neumann stored program architecture some cases computer might store some all its program memory that kept separate from data operates on this called harvard architecture after harvard mark i computer modern von neumann computers display some traits harvard architecture their designs such cpu caches while possible write computer programs long lists numbers machine language while this technique was used with many early computers extremely tedious potentially error-prone do so practice especially for complicated programs instead each basic instruction can be given short name that indicative its function easy remember – mnemonic such add sub mult jump these mnemonics are collectively known computers assembly language converting programs written assembly language into something computer can actually understand machine language usually done by computer program called assembler 1970s punched card containing one line from fortran program card reads z1 = y + w1 labeled proj039 for identification purposes programming language main article programming language programming languages provide various ways specifying programs for computers run unlike natural languages programming languages are designed permit no ambiguity be concise they are purely written languages are often difficult read aloud they are generally either translated into machine code by compiler assembler before being run translated directly at run time by interpreter sometimes programs are executed by hybrid method two techniques low-level languages main article low-level programming language machine languages assembly languages that represent them collectively termed low-level programming languages tend be unique particular type computer for instance arm architecture computer such may be found smartphone hand-held videogame cannot understand machine language x86 cpu that might be pc high-level languages/third generation language main article high-level programming language though considerably easier than machine language writing long programs assembly language often difficult also error prone therefore most practical programs are written more abstract high-level programming languages that are able express needs programmer more conveniently thereby help reduce programmer error high level languages are usually compiled into machine language sometimes into assembly language then into machine language using another computer program called compiler high level languages are less related workings target computer than assembly language more related language structure problems be solved by final program therefore often possible use different compilers translate same high level language program into machine language many different types computer this part means by which software like video games may be made available for different computer architectures such personal computers various video game consoles fourth generation languages these 4g languages are less

slimline computer general purpose computer has four main components arithmetic logic unit alu control unit memory input output devices collectively termed i/o these parts are interconnected by buses often made groups wires inside each these parts are thousands trillions small electrical circuits which can be turned off on by means electronic switch each circuit represents bit binary digit information so that when circuit on represents when off represents positive logic representation circuits are arranged logic gates so that one more circuits may control state one more other circuits control unit main articles cpu design control unit diagram showing how particular mips architecture instruction would be decoded by control system control unit often called control system central controller manages computers various components reads interprets decodes program instructions transforming them into control signals that activate other parts computer control systems advanced computers may change order execution some instructions improve performance key component common all cpus program counter special memory cell register that keeps track which location memory next instruction be read from control systems function follows—note that this simplified description some these steps may be performed concurrently different order depending on type cpu read code for next instruction from cell indicated by program counter decode numerical code for instruction into set commands signals for each other systems increment program counter so points next instruction read whatever data instruction requires from cells memory perhaps from input device location this required data typically stored within instruction code provide necessary data alu register if instruction

conceptually just another set memory cells can be changed by calculations done alu adding program counter would cause next instruction be read from place locations further down program instructions that modify program counter are often known jumps allow for loops instructions that are repeated by computer often conditional instruction execution both examples control flow sequence operations that control unit goes through process instruction itself like short computer program indeed some more complex cpu designs there another yet smaller computer called microsequencer which runs microcode program that causes all these events happen central processing unit cpu control unit alu registers are collectively known central processing unit cpu early cpus were composed many separate components but since mid-1970s cpus have typically been constructed on single integrated circuit called microprocessor arithmetic logic unit alu main article arithmetic logic unit alu capable performing two classes operations arithmetic logic set arithmetic operations that particular alu supports may be limited addition subtraction might include multiplication division trigonometry functions such sine cosine etc square roots some can only operate on whole numbers integers whilst others use floating point represent real numbers albeit with limited precision however any computer that capable performing just simplest operations can be programmed break down more complex operations into simple steps that can perform therefore any computer can be programmed perform any arithmetic operation—although will take more time do so if its alu does not directly support operation alu may also compare numbers return boolean truth values true false depending on whether one equal greater than less than other greater than logic operations involve boolean logic xor not these can be useful for creating complicated conditional statements processing boolean logic superscalar computers may contain multiple alus allowing them process several instructions simultaneously graphics processors computers with simd mimd features often contain alus that can perform arithmetic on vectors matrices memory main article computer data storage magnetic core memory was computer memory choice throughout 1960s until was replaced by semiconductor memory computers memory can be viewed list cells into which numbers can be placed read each cell has numbered address can store single number computer can be instructed put number into cell numbered add number that cell number that cell put answer into cell information stored memory may represent practically anything letters numbers even computer instructions can be placed into memory with equal ease since cpu does not differentiate between different types information softwares responsibility give significance what memory sees nothing but series numbers almost all modern computers each memory cell set up store binary numbers groups eight bits called byte each byte able represent different numbers = either from −128 store larger numbers several consecutive bytes may be used typically two four eight when negative numbers are required they are usually stored twos complement notation other arrangements are possible but are usually not seen outside specialized applications historical contexts computer can store any kind information memory if can be represented numerically modern computers have billions even trillions bytes memory cpu contains special set memory cells called registers that can be read written much more rapidly than main memory area there are typically between two one hundred registers depending on type cpu registers are used for most frequently needed data items avoid having access main memory every time data needed data constantly being worked on reducing need access main memory which often slow compared alu control units greatly increases computers speed computer main memory comes two principal varieties random-access memory ram read-only memory rom ram can be read written anytime cpu commands but rom preloaded with data software that never changes therefore cpu can only read from rom typically used store computers initial start-up instructions general contents ram are erased when power computer turned off but rom retains its data indefinitely pc rom contains specialized program called bios that orchestrates loading computers operating system from hard disk drive into ram whenever computer turned on reset embedded computers which frequently do not have disk drives all required software may be stored rom software stored rom often called firmware because notionally more like hardware than software flash memory blurs distinction between rom ram retains its data when turned off but also rewritable typically much slower than conventional rom ram however so its use restricted applications where high speed unnecessary more sophisticated computers there may be one more ram cache memories which are slower than registers but faster than main memory generally computers with this sort cache are designed move frequently needed data into cache automatically often without need for any intervention on programmers part input/output i/o main article input/output hard disk drives are common storage devices used with computers i/o means by which computer exchanges information with outside world devices that provide input output computer are called peripherals on typical personal computer peripherals include input devices like keyboard mouse output devices such display printer hard disk drives floppy disk drives optical disc drives serve both input output devices computer networking another form i/o i/o devices are often complex computers their own right with their own cpu memory graphics processing unit might contain fifty more tiny computers that perform calculations necessary display graphics modern desktop computers contain many smaller computers that assist main cpu performing i/o 2016-era flat screen display contains its own computer circuitry multitasking main article computer multitasking while computer may be viewed running one gigantic program stored its main memory some systems necessary give appearance running several programs simultaneously this achieved by multitasking ie having computer switch rapidly between running each program turn one means by which this done with special signal called interrupt which can periodically cause computer stop executing instructions where was do something else instead by remembering where was executing prior interrupt computer can return that task later if several programs are running at same time then interrupt generator might be causing several hundred interrupts per second causing program switch each time since modern computers typically execute instructions several orders magnitude faster than human perception may appear that many programs are running at same time even though only one ever executing any given instant this method multitasking sometimes termed time-sharing since each program allocated slice time turn before era inexpensive computers principal use for multitasking was allow many people share same computer seemingly multitasking would cause computer that switching between several programs run more slowly direct proportion number programs running but most programs spend much their time waiting for slow input/output devices complete their tasks if program waiting for user click on mouse press key on keyboard then will not take time slice until event waiting for has occurred this frees up time for other programs execute so that many programs may be run simultaneously without unacceptable speed loss multiprocessing main article multiprocessing cray designed many supercomputers that used multiprocessing heavily some computers are designed distribute their work across several cpus multiprocessing configuration technique once employed only large powerful machines such supercomputers mainframe computers servers multiprocessor multi-core multiple cpus on single integrated circuit personal laptop computers are now widely available are being increasingly used lower-end markets result supercomputers particular often have highly unique architectures that differ significantly from basic stored-program architecture from general purpose computers they often feature thousands cpus customized high-speed interconnects specialized computing hardware such designs tend be useful only for specialized tasks due large scale program organization required successfully utilize most available resources at once supercomputers usually see usage large-scale simulation graphics rendering cryptography applications well with other so-called embarrassingly parallel tasks networking internet main articles computer networking internet visualization portion routes on internet computers have been used coordinate information between multiple locations since 1950s us militarys sage system was first large-scale example such system which led number special-purpose commercial systems such sabre 1970s computer engineers at research institutions throughout united states began link their computers together using telecommunications technology effort was funded by arpa now darpa computer network that resulted was called arpanet technologies that made arpanet possible spread evolved time network spread beyond academic military institutions became known internet emergence networking involved redefinition nature boundaries computer computer operating systems applications were modified include ability define access resources other computers on network such peripheral devices stored information like extensions resources individual computer initially these facilities were available primarily people working high-tech environments but 1990s spread applications like e-mail world wide web combined with development cheap fast networking technologies like ethernet adsl saw computer networking become almost ubiquitous fact number computers that are networked growing phenomenally very large proportion personal computers regularly connect internet communicate receive information wireless networking often utilizing mobile phone networks has meant networking becoming increasingly ubiquitous even mobile computing

rogue dungeon on pdp-10 these games predate commercial gaming industry internet but still featured persistent worlds other elements mmogs still used today first graphical mmog major milestone creation genre was multiplayer flight combat simulation game air warrior by kesmai on genie online service which first appeared kesmai later added graphics game making first mmo commercial mmorpgs gained acceptance late 1980s early 1990s genre was pioneered by gemstone series on genie also created by kesmai neverwinter nights first such game include graphics which debuted on aol video game developers applied mmog ideas other computer video game genres new acronyms started develop such mmorts mmog emerged generic term cover this growing class games debuts realm online meridian first mmorpg ultima online underlight everquest late 1990s popularized mmorpg genre growth technology meant that where neverwinter nights had been limited simultaneous players number that grew by by year multitude mmorpgs were each serving thousands simultaneous players led way for games such world warcraft eve online despite genres focus on multiplayer gaming ai-controlled characters are still common npcs mobs who give out quests serve opponents are typical mmorpgs ai-controlled characters are not common action-based mmogs popularity mmogs was mostly restricted computer game market until sixth-generation consoles with launch phantasy star online on dreamcast emergence growth online service xbox live there have been number console mmogs including everquest online adventures playstation multiconsole

everquest result per-capita gdp dollars which would have placed virtual world everquest 77th wealthiest nation on par with croatia ecuador tunisia vietnam world warcraft dominant mmog with 8-9 million monthly subscribers worldwide subscriber base dropped by million after expansion wrath lich king bringing million subscribers though remained most popular western title among mmogs western consumer spending on world warcraft represented 58% share subscription mmog market title has generated over $22 billion cumulative consumer spending on subscriptions from through virtual economies main article virtual economy within majority mmogs created there virtual currency where player can earn accumulate money uses for such virtual currency are numerous vary from game game virtual economies created within mmogs often blur lines between real virtual worlds result often seen unwanted interaction between real virtual economies by players provider virtual world this practice economy interaction mostly seen this genre games two seem come hand hand with even earliest mmogs such ultima online having this kind trade real money for virtual things importance having working virtual economy within mmog increasing they develop sign this ccp games hiring first real-life economist for its mmog eve online assist analyze virtual economy production within this game results this interaction between virtual economy our real economy which really interaction between company that created game third-party companies that want share profits success game this battle between companies defended on both sides company originating game intellectual property argue that this violation terms agreements game well copyright violation since they own rights how online currency distributed through what channels case that third-party companies their customers defend that they are selling exchanging time effort put into acquisition currency not digital information itself they also express that nature many mmogs that they require time commitments not available everyone result without external acquisition virtual currency some players are severely limited being able experience certain aspects game practice acquiring large volumes virtual currency for purpose selling other individuals for tangible real currency called gold farming many players who have poured all their personal effort resent that there this exchange between real virtual economies since devalues their own efforts result term gold farmer now has very negative connotation within games their communities this slander has unfortunately also extended itself racial profiling in-game forum insulting reaction from many game companies varies games that are substantially less popular have small player base enforcement elimination gold farming appears less often companies this situation most likely are concerned with their personal sales subscription revenue over development their virtual economy they most likely have higher priority games viability via adequate funding games with enormous player base consequently much higher sales subscription income can take more drastic actions more often much larger volumes this account banning could also serve economic gain for these large games since highly likely that due demand these gold farming accounts will be recreated with freshly bought copies game virtual goods revenue from online games social networking exceeded us$7 billion was estimated that up people china vietnam are playing online games gather gold other items for sale western players however single player mmos quite viable especially what called player vs environment gameplay this may result player being unable experience all content many most significant potentially rewarding game experiences are events which require large coordinated teams complete most mmogs also share other characteristics that make them different from other multiplayer online games mmogs host large number players single game world all those players can interact with each other at any given time popular mmogs might have thousands players online at any given time usually on company owned servers non-mmogs such battlefield half-life usually have fewer than players online per server are usually played on private servers also mmogs usually do not have any significant mods since game must work on company servers there some debate if high head-count requirement be mmog some say that size game world its capability support large number players that should matter for example despite technology content constraints most mmogs can fit up few thousand players on single game server at time support all those players mmogs need large-scale game worlds servers connect players those worlds some games have all their servers connected so all players are connected shared universe others have copies their starting game world put on different servers called shards for sharded universe shards got their name from ultima online where story shards mondains gem created duplicate worlds still others will only use one part universe at any time for example tribes which not mmog comes with number large maps which are played rotation one at time contrast similar title planetside allows all map-like areas game be reached via flying driving teleporting mmorpgs usually have sharded universes they provide most flexible solution server load problem but not always for example space simulation eve online uses only one large cluster server peaking at over simultaneous players technical aspect challenging develop database engines that are needed run successful mmog with millions players many developers have created their own but attempts have been made create middleware software that would help game developers concentrate on their games more than technical aspects one such piece middleware called bigworld early successful entry into field was vr-1 entertainment whose conductor platform was adopted endorsed by variety service providers around world including sony communications network japan bertelsmann game channel germany british telecoms wireplay england dacom samsung sds south korea games that were powered by conductor platform included fighter wing air attack fighter ace evernight hasbro em@ail games clue nascar soccer towers fallow sarac project vr1 crossroads rumble void typical muds other predecessor games were limited about simultaneous player connections this was limit imposed by underlying operating system which was usually unix-like one bigger problems with modern engines has been handling vast number players since typical server can handle around 10000–12000 players 4000–5000 active simultaneously dividing game into several servers has up until now been solution this approach has also helped with technical issues such lag that many players experience another difficulty especially relevant real-time simulation games time synchronization across

per seconds this allows each player accurately control multiple vehicles pedestrians racing combat simulations world war ii online simulation game showing numbers players during special event june some people had spawned for this gathering this location game some mmogs have been designed accurately simulate certain aspects real world they tend be very specific industries activities very large risk huge potential loss such rocket science airplanes trucks battle tanks submarines etc gradually simulation technology getting more mainstream so too various simulators arrive into more mundane industries initial goal world war ii online was create map north western europe that had real world physics gravity air/water resistance etc ability for players have some strategic abilities its basic fps/rpg role while current version not quite true simulated world very complex contains large persistent world mmog genre air traffic simulation one example with networks such vatsim ivao striving provide rigorously authentic flight-simulation environments players both pilot air traffic controller roles this category mmogs objective create duplicates real world for people who cannot do not wish undertake those experiences real life for example flight simulation via mmog requires far less expenditure time money completely risk-free far less restrictive fewer regulations adhere no medical exams pass so on another specialist area mobile telecoms operator carrier business where billion-dollar investments networks are needed but marketshares are won lost on issues from segmentation handset subsidies specialist simulation was developed by nokia called equilibrium/arbitrage have over two-day period five teams top management one operator/carrier play wargame against each other under extremely realistic conditions with one operator incumbent fixed mobile network operator another new entrant mobile operator third fixed-line/internet operator etc each team measured by outperforming their rivals by market expectations that type player thus each player has drastically different goals but within simulation any one team can win also ensure maximum intensity only one team can win telecoms senior executives who have taken equilibrium/arbitrage simulation say most intense most useful training they have ever experienced typical business use simulators very senior

mmors included upshift strikeracer need for speed world both which have since shut down trackmania series worlds largest mmo racing game holds world record for most players single online race although darkwind war on wheels more combat-based than racing also considered mmor casual many types mmo games can be classified casual because they are designed appeal all computer users opposed subgroup

peer-to-peer p2p mmogs have been made outback online may be first commercial one however so far most efforts have been academic studies p2p mmog may potentially be more scalable cheaper build but notable issues with p2p mmogs include security consistency control which can be difficult address given that clients are easily hacked some mmogs such vindictus use p2p networking client-server networking together april united states army announced that was developing massively multiplayer training simulation called awe asymmetric warfare environment purpose awe train soldiers for urban warfare there are no plans for public commercial release forterra systems developing for army based on there engine bonnie nardi published ethnographic study on world warcraft examined with lev vygotskys activity theory field mmos grows larger each year research has also begun investigate socio-informatic bind games create for their users researchers constance steinkuehler dmitri williams initiated research on such topics topic most intriguing pair was further understand gameplay well virtual world serving social meeting place popular mmos further explore effects social capital social relationships on mmos steinkuehler williams combined conclusions from two different mmo research projects sociocultural perspective on culture cognition other on media effects mmos conclusions two studies explained how mmos function new form third place for informal social interactions much like coffee shops pubs other typical hangouts many scholars however such oldenburg refute idea mmos serving third place due inadequate bridging social capital his argument challenged by putnam who concluded that mmos are well suited for formation bridging social capital tentative relationships that lack depth because inclusive serves sociological lubricant that shown across data collected both research studies mmos can also move past lubricant stage into superglue stage known bonding social capital closer relationship that characterized by stronger connections emotional support study concludes that mmos function best bridging mechanism rather than bonding one similar third place therefore mmos have capacity ability serve community that effectively socializes users just like coffee shop pub but conveniently comfort their own home spending british online gamers are outspending

conference that market for console games $59 billion revenue was times that computer-game market $430 million computer games however did not disappear by computer gaming world reported that industry moving toward heavy use vga graphics while some games were advertised with vga support at start year they usually supported ega graphics through vga cards by end however most publishers moved at supporting at least 320x200 mcga subset vga vga gave pc graphics that outmatched amiga increasing adoption computer mouse driven partially by success adventure games such highly successful kings quest series high resolution bitmap displays allowed industry include increasingly high-quality graphical interfaces new releases further improvements game artwork audio were made possible with introduction fm synthesis sound yamaha began manufacturing fm synth boards for computers early-mid-1980s by nec fm-7 computers had built-in fm sound first pc sound cards such adlibs music synthesizer card soon appeared these cards allowed ibm pc compatible computers produce complex sounds using fm synthesis where they had previously been limited simple tones beeps however rise creative labs sound blaster card released which featured much higher sound quality due inclusion pcm channel digital signal processor led adlib file for bankruptcy by also fm towns computer included built-in pcm sound addition cd-rom drive 24-bit color graphics by dos comprised 65% computer-game market with amiga at 10% all other computers including apple macintosh were below 10% declining although both apple ibm tried avoid customers associating their products with game machines latter acknowledged that vga audio joystick options for its ps/1 computer were popular id software produced early first-person shooter hovertank which was companys first their line highly influential games genre there were also several other companies that produced early first-person shooters such arsys softwares star cruiser which

console systems kept their cpu speed at 3–7 mhz pc processor ran much faster allowing perform many more calculations per second release doom on pc was breakthrough graphics was soon ported various game consoles general shift toward greater realism cd-rom had much larger storage capacity than floppies helped reduce software piracy was less expensive produce chris crawford warned that was data-intensive technology not process-intensive one tempting developers emphasize quantity digital assets like art music over quality gameplay computer gaming world wrote that publishers may be losing their focus while many companies used additional storage release poor-quality shovelware collections older software enhanced versions existing ones new games such myst included many more assets for richer game experience enhance immersive experience with their unrealistic graphics electronic sound early pc games included extras such peril-sensitive sunglasses that shipped with hitchhikers guide galaxy science fiction novella included with elite these extras gradually became less common but many games were still sold traditional oversized boxes that used hold extra feelies today such extras are usually found only special edition versions games such battlechests from blizzard contemporary gaming by pc games required much more memory than other software often consuming all conventional memory while peripheral device drivers could go into upper memory with dos memory managers players found modifying configsys autoexecbat files for memory management cumbersome confusing each game needed different configuration game les manley satirized this by depicting two beautiful women exhaust hero bed by requesting that he again explain difference between extended expanded memory computer gaming world provided technical assistance its writers help install games for review criticized nonstandard software like origin systemss infamous late unlamented voodoo memory manager which used

changes microsoft windows operating system by then market leader made many older dos-based games unplayable on windows nt later windows xp without using emulator such dosbox faster graphics accelerators improving cpu technology resulted increasing levels realism computer games during this time improvements introduced with products such atis radeon r300 nvidia s geforce series have allowed developers increase complexity modern game engines pc gaming currently tends strongly toward improvements graphics unlike generally accepted push for improved graphical performance use physics engines computer games has become matter debate since announcement release nvidia physx ppu ostensibly competing with middleware such havok physics engine issues such difficulty ensuring consistent experiences for all players uncertain benefit first generation physx cards games such tom clancys ghost recon advanced warfighter city villains prompted arguments over value such technology similarly many game publishers began experiment with new forms marketing chief among these alternative strategies episodic gaming adaptation older concept expansion packs which game content provided smaller quantities but for proportionally lower price titles such half-life episode one took advantage idea with mixed results rising from concerns for amount content provided for price platform characteristics fidelity high-end pc gaming pc will generally have far more processing resources at its disposal than other gaming systems game developers can use this improve visual fidelity their game relative other platforms but even if they do not games running on pc are likely benefit from higher screen resolution higher framerate anti-aliasing increased draw distance also common open world games better hardware also increases potential fidelity pc games rules simulation pc games often support more players npcs than equivalents on other platforms game designs which depend on simulation large numbers tokens eg guild wars sid meiers civilization v are rarely seen anywhere else pc also supports greater input fidelity thanks its compatibility with wide array peripherals most common forms input are mouse/keyboard combination gamepads though touchscreens motion controllers are also available mouse particular lends players first-person shooter real-time strategy games on pc great speed accuracy openness defining characteristic pc platform absence centralized control all other gaming platforms except android devices extent are owned administered by single group advantages openness include reduced software cost prices are kept down by competition absence platform-holder fees games services are cheaper at every level many are free increased flexibility pc games decades old can be played on modern systems through emulation software if need be conversely newer games can often be run on older systems by reducing games fidelity and/or scale increased innovation one does not need ask for permission release update pc game modify existing one platforms hardware software are constantly evolving these factors make pc centre both hardware software innovation by comparison closed platforms tend remain much same throughout their lifespan but there are also disadvantages including increased complexity pc general-purpose tool its inner workings are exposed owner misconfiguration can create enormous problems hardware compatibility issues are also possible game development complicated by wide variety hardware configurations developers may be forced limit their design run with sub-optimum pc hardware order reach larger pc market add range graphical other settings adjust for playability on individual machines requiring increased development test customer support resources increased hardware cost pc components are generally sold individually for profit even if one buys pre-built machine whereas hardware closed platforms mass-produced single unit often sold at smaller profit even loss with intention making profit instead online service fees developer kit profits reduced security difficult most situations ultimately impossible control way which pc hardware software used this leads far more software piracy cheating than closed platforms suffer from mods main article mod video gaming openness pc platform allows players edit their games distribute results over internet mods healthy mod community greatly increases games longevity most popular mods have driven purchases their parent game record heights common for professional developers release tools they use create their games sometimes even source code order encourage modding but if game popular enough mods generally arise even without official support mods can compete with official downloadable content however even outright redistribute their ability extend lifespan game can work against its developers plans for regular sequels game technology has become more complex has also become harder distribute development tools public modding has different connotation on consoles which are typically restricted much more heavily publicly released development tools are rare console mods usually refer hardware alterations designed remove restrictions dominant software although pc platform almost completely decentralized at hardware level there are two dominant software forces microsoft windows operating system steam distribution service microsoft introduced operating environment named windows on november add-on dos response growing interest graphical user interfaces guis microsoft windows came dominate worlds personal computer market with over 90% market share overtaking mac os which had been introduced valve does not release any sales figures on its steam service instead only provides data companies with games on steam which they cannot release without permission due signing non-disclosure agreement with valve however stardock previous owner competing platform impulse estimated that steam had 70% share digital distribution market for video games early forbes reported that steam sales constituted 50–70% $4 billion market for downloaded pc games that steam offered game producers gross margins 70% purchase price compared with 30% at retail steam served over petabytes information double what had delivered digital distribution services main article digital distribution video games pc games are sold predominantly through internet with buyers downloading their new purchase directly their computer this approach allows smaller independent developers compete with large publisher-backed games avoids speed capacity limits optical discs which most other gaming platforms rely on valve corporation released steam platform for windows computers means distribute valve-developed video games such half-life would later see release on mac os x operating system was released on linux well by controlled 70% market for downloadable pc games with userbase about

services on pc such amazon digital services gamestop gfwl ea store direct2drive gogcom gamersgate digital distribution also slashes cost circulation eliminates stock shortages allows games be released worldwide at no additional cost allows niche audiences be reached with ease however most digital distribution systems create ownership customer rights issues by storing access rights on distributor-owned computers games confer with these computers over internet before launching this raises prospect purchases being lost if distributor goes out business chooses lock buyers account

'action game from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search action game video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges including hand–eye coordination reaction-time genre includes diverse subgenres such fighting games shooter games platform games which are widely considered most important action games though some real-time strategy games are also considered be action games action game player typically controls avatar protagonist avatar must navigate level collecting objects avoiding obstacles battling enemies with various attacks at end level group levels player must often defeat large boss enemy that larger more challenging than other enemies enemy attacks obstacles deplete avatars health lives game over when player runs out lives alternatively player wins game by finishing sequence levels but some action games usually arcade games are unbeatable have indefinite number levels players only goal maximize their score by collecting objects defeating enemies contents defining elements game design o levels o character abilities o obstacles enemies o health lives o graphics interface o scoring victory subgenres physical impact history references defining elements action genre includes any game where majority challenges are physical tests skill action games can sometimes incorporate other challenges such races puzzles collecting objects but they are not central genre players may also encounter tactical exploration challenges but these games first-and-foremost require high reaction speed good hand–eye coordination player often under time pressure there not enough time for complex strategic planning general faster action games are more challenging action games may sometimes involve puzzle solving but they are usually quite simple because player under immense time pressure game design levels players advance through action game by completing series levels levels are often grouped by theme with similar graphics enemies each level involves variety challenges whether dancing dance game shooting things shooter which player must overcome win game older games force players restart level after dying although action games evolved offer saved games checkpoints allow player restart partway through level increasingly though some games allow for resurrection cloning opportunity regain lost items upon death for certain sum ingame currency typically increasing exponentially more times player dies obstacles enemies level do not usually vary between play sessions allowing players learn by trial error however levels sometimes add element randomness such enemy that randomly appears that takes unpredictable path levels action game may be linear nonlinear sometimes include shortcuts for levels that require exploration player may need search for level exit that hidden guarded by enemies such levels can also contain secrets—hidden hard-to-reach objects places that contain something valuable prize can be bonus see below non-standard exit that allows player access hidden level jump ahead several levels action games sometimes offer teleporter that will cause players avatar re-appear somewhere else same level levels often make use locked doors that can only be opened with specific key found somewhere else level action games sometimes make use time restrictions increase challenge however game levels typically do not react time passing day/night cycles are rare when timer expires player typically loses life although some games generate difficult enemy challenge if level completed with time remaining this usually adds players score character abilities most action games player controls single avatar protagonist avatar has ability navigate maneuver often collects manipulates objects they have range defenses attacks such shooting punching many action games make use powerful attack that destroys all enemies within limited range but this attack rare players may find power-up within game world that grants temporary permanent improvements their abilities for example avatar may gain increase speed more powerful attacks temporary shield from attacks some action games even allow players spend upgrade points on power ups their choice action games most avatars character development comes from power-ups new moves mental states do not usually change progress obstacles enemies action games that involve navigating space players will encounter obstacles traps enemies enemies typically follow fixed patterns attack player although newer action games may make use more complex artificial intelligence pursue player enemies sometimes appears groups waves with enemies increasing strength number until end level enemies may also appear out thin air this can involve invisible spawn point visible generator which can be destroyed by player these points may generate enemies indefinitely only up certain number at end level group themed levels players often encounter boss this boss enemy will often resemble larger more difficult version regular enemy boss may require special weapon attack method such striking when boss opens their mouth attacking particular part boss health lives many action games avatar has certain amount hitmarkers health which are depleted by enemy attacks other hazards sometimes health can be replenished by collecting in-game object when player runs out health player dies players avatar often given small number chances retry after death typically referred lives upon beginning new life player resumes game either from same location they died checkpoint start level upon starting new life avatar typically invincible for few seconds allow player re-orient themselves players may earn extra lives by reaching certain score by finding in-game object arcade games still limit number player lives while home video games have shifted increasingly unlimited lives graphics interface action games take place either from variety perspectives action games typically use side view top-down view screen frequently scrolls player explores level although many games scroll through level automatically push player forward action games perspective usually tied avatar from first-person third-person perspective however some games offer context-sensitive perspective that controlled by artificial intelligence camera most what player needs know contained within single screen although action games frequently make use heads-up display that display important information such health ammunition action games sometimes make use maps which can be accessed during lulls action mini-map that always visible scoring victory action games tend set simple goals reaching them obvious common goal defeat end-of-game boss this often presented form structured story with happy ending upon winning game some games goal changes player reveals more story many action games keep track players score points are awarded for completing certain challenges defeating certain enemies skillful play often rewarded with point multipliers such pac-man where each ghost that avatar eats will generate twice many points last sometimes action games will offer bonus objects that increase players score there no penalty for failing collect them although these bonus objects may unlock hidden levels special events many action games achieving high score only goal levels increase difficulty until player loses arcade games are more likely be unbeatable they make their money by forcing player lose game on other hand games sold at home are more likely have discrete victory conditions since publisher wants player purchase another game when they are done subgenres action games have several major subgenres however there are many action games without any clear subgenre such frogger well other types genres like adventure strategy that have action elements beat em ups are games that involve fighting through side-scrolling stage multiple adversaries using martial arts other close-range fighting techniques fighting games feature combat between pairs fighters usually using martial arts moves actions are limited various attacks defenses matches end when fighters health reduced zero they often make use special moves combos there are both fighting games but most fighting games largely take place plane occasionally include side-stepping they are distinct from sports games such boxing wrestling games which attempt model movements techniques more realistically maze games such pac-man involve navigating maze avoid chase adversaries platform games involve jumping between platforms different heights while battling enemies avoiding obstacles physics are often unrealistic game levels are often vertically exaggerated they exist both forms rhythm action games challenge players sense rhythm award points for accurately pressing certain buttons sync with musical beat this relatively new subgenre action game rhythm games are sometimes classified type music game shooter games allow player take action at distance using ranged weapon challenging them aim with accuracy although shooting usually form violence non-violent shooters exist well this subgenre includes first-person shooters third-person shooters well plethora other shoot em up games taking place from top-down side-view perspective physical impact studies have shown that people can improve their eyesight by playing action video games tests by scientists at university rochester on college students showed that over period month performance eye examinations improved by about 20% those playing unreal tournament compared those playing tetris most arcade games are action games because they can be difficult for unskilled players thus make more money quickly researchers from helsinki school economics have shown that people playing first-person shooter might secretly enjoy that their character gets killed game although their expressions might show contrary game used study was james bond nightfire history major turning point for action games came with release shoot em up game space invaders which marked beginning golden age arcade video games result space invaders mainstream success industry came be dominated by action games which have remained most dominant genre video arcades on game consoles through present day along with space invaders asteroids from pac-man from have also become iconic examples from action genre robotron released arcades also became classic shooter subgenre much same way space invaders set template for shooter game subgenre donkey kong did same for platform game

december language expanded rapidly over next few years perl released featured better regular expression engine perl released added support for binary data streams originally only documentation for perl was single increasingly lengthy man page programming perl known many perl programmers camel book because its cover was published became de facto reference for language at same time perl version number was bumped not mark major change language but identify version that was well documented by book early perl main article perl version history perl went through series maintenance releases culminating perl at that point wall abandoned perl begin work on perl initial design perl continued into perl5-porters mailing list was established may coordinate work on porting perl different platforms remains primary forum for development maintenance porting perl perl was released on october was nearly complete rewrite interpreter added many new features language including objects references lexical my variables modules importantly modules provided mechanism for extending language without modifying interpreter this allowed core interpreter stabilize even enabled ordinary perl programmers add new language features perl has been active development since then perl was released on march perl was released on february with new prototypes feature this allowed module authors make subroutines that behaved like perl builtins perl was released june security release one most important events perl history took place outside language proper was consequence its module support on october comprehensive perl archive network cpan was established repository for perl modules perl itself june carries over modules distributions written by more than authors mirrored worldwide at more than locations perl was released on may included among other things universal package giving perl base object which all classes were automatically derived ability require versions modules another significant development was inclusion cgipm module which contributed perls popularity cgi scripting language perl also now supported running under microsoft windows several other operating systems perl was released on july this release included several enhancements regex engine new hooks into backend through b modules qr// regex quote operator large selection other new core modules added

open source projects after next version became with plans for development versions have odd numbers stable versions have even numbers wall put forth call for suggestions for new version perl from community process resulted rfc request for comments documents that were be used guiding development perl work began on apocalypses for perl series documents meant summarize change requests present design next generation perl they were presented digest rfcs rather than formal document at this point perl existed only description language perl was first released on july had nearly yearly updates since then perl improved unicode support added new i/o implementation added new thread implementation improved numeric accuracy added several new modules this version still remains most popular version perl used by red hat suse solaris hp-ux aix work began on synopses – documents that originally summarized apocalypses but which became specification for perl language february audrey tang began work on pugs perl interpreter written haskell this was first concerted effort towards making perl reality this effort stalled on december 20th anniversary perl perl was released perl included notable new features which brought closer perl these included switch statement called given/when regular expressions updates smart match operator ~~ around this same time development began earnest on another implementation perl known rakudo perl developed tandem with parrot virtual machine november rakudo perl has had regular monthly releases now most complete implementation perl major change development process perl occurred with perl development community has switched monthly release cycle development releases with yearly schedule stable releases by that plan bugfix point releases will

release perl with start modern perl movement particular this phrase describes style development that embraces use cpan takes advantage recent developments language rigorous about creating high quality code while book modern perl may be most visible standard-bearer this idea other groups such enlightened perl organization have taken up cause late several projects for alternative implementations for perl started perl5 perl6 by rakudo perl team moe by stevan little friends p2 by perl11 team under reini urban gperl by goccy rperl kickstarter project led by will braswell affiliated with perll11 project ponie ponie acronym for perl on new internal engine ponie project existed from until was be bridge between perl perl was effort rewrite perl interpreter run on parrot perl virtual machine goal was ensure future millions lines perl code at thousands companies around world ponie project ended no longer being actively developed some improvements made perl interpreter part ponie were folded into that project name perl was originally named pearl wall wanted give language short name with positive connotations he claims that he considered rejected every three- four-letter word dictionary he also considered naming after his wife gloria wall discovered existing pearl programming language before perls official release changed spelling name when referring language name normally capitalized perl proper noun when referring interpreter program itself name often uncapitalized perl because most unix-like file systems are case-sensitive before release first edition programming perl was common refer language perl randal l schwartz however capitalized languages name book make stand out better when typeset this case distinction was subsequently documented canonical name occasionally expanded practical extraction report language but this backronym other expansions have been suggested equally canonical including walls own humorous pathologically eclectic rubbish lister indeed wall claims that name was intended inspire many different expansions camel symbol camel symbol used by oreilly media programming perl published by oreilly media features picture dromedary camel on cover commonly called camel book this image camel has become unofficial symbol perl well general hacker emblem appearing on t-shirts other clothing items oreilly owns image trademark but licenses for non-commercial use requiring only acknowledgement link wwwperlcom licensing for commercial use decided on case by case basis oreilly also provides programming republic perl logos for non-commercial sites powered by perl buttons for any site that uses perl onion symbol onion logo used by perl foundation perl foundation owns alternative symbol onion which licenses its subsidiaries perl mongers perlmonks perlorg others symbol visual pun on pearl onion overview main article perl language structure according wall perl has two slogans first theres more than one way do commonly known tmtowtdi second slogan easy things should be easy hard things should be possible features overall structure perl derives broadly from c perl procedural nature with variables expressions assignment statements brace -delimited blocks control structures subroutines perl also takes features from shell programming all variables are marked with leading sigils which allow variables be interpolated directly into strings however unlike shell perl uses sigils on all accesses variables unlike most other programming languages that use sigils sigil doesnt denote type variable but type expression so for example access list values hash sigil for array @ used not sigil for hash % perl also has many built-in functions that provide tools often used shell programming although many these tools are implemented by programs external shell such sorting calling operating system facilities perl takes lists from lisp hashes associative arrays from awk regular expressions from sed these simplify facilitate many parsing text-handling data-management tasks also shared with lisp are implicit return last value block fact that all statements have value thus are also expressions can be used larger expressions themselves perl added features that support complex data structures first-class functions that closures values object-oriented programming model these include references packages class-based method dispatch lexically scoped variables along with compiler directives for example strict pragma major additional feature introduced with perl was ability package code reusable modules wall later stated that whole intent perl 5s module system was encourage growth perl culture rather than perl core all versions perl do automatic data-typing automatic memory management interpreter knows type storage requirements every data object program allocates frees storage for them necessary using reference counting so cannot deallocate circular data structures without manual intervention legal type conversions — for example conversions from number string — are done automatically at run time illegal type conversions are fatal errors design design perl can be understood response three broad trends computer industry falling hardware costs rising labor costs improvements compiler technology many earlier computer languages such fortran c aimed make efficient use expensive computer hardware contrast perl was designed so that computer programmers could write programs more quickly easily perl has many features that ease task programmer at expense greater cpu memory requirements these include automatic memory management dynamic typing strings lists hashes regular expressions introspection eval function perl follows theory no built-in limits idea similar zero one infinity rule wall was trained linguist design perl very much informed by linguistic principles examples include huffman coding common constructions should be short good end-weighting important information should come first large collection language primitives perl favors language constructs that are concise natural for humans write even where they complicate perl interpreter perls syntax reflects idea that things that are different should look different for example scalars arrays hashes have different leading sigils array indices hash keys use different kinds braces strings regular expressions have different standard delimiters this approach can be contrasted with language such lisp where same basic syntax composed simple universal symbolic expressions used for all purposes perl does not enforce any particular programming paradigm procedural object-oriented functional others even require programmer choose among them there broad practical bent both perl language community culture that surround preface programming perl begins perl language for getting your job done one consequence this that perl not tidy language includes many features tolerates exceptions its rules employs heuristics resolve syntactical ambiguities because forgiving nature compiler bugs can sometimes be hard find perls function documentation remarks on variant behavior built-in functions list scalar contexts by saying general they do what you want unless you want consistency no written specification standard for perl language exists for perl versions through perl there are no plans create one for current version perl there has been only one implementation interpreter language has evolved along with that interpreter together with its functional tests stands de facto specification language perl however started with specification several projects aim implement some all specification applications perl has many varied applications compounded by availability many standard third-party modules perl has chiefly been used write cgi scripts large projects written perl include cpanel slash bugzilla rt twiki movable type high-traffic websites that use perl extensively include pricelinecom craigslist imdb livejournal duckduckgo slashdot ticketmaster also optional component popular lamp technology stack for web development lieu php python perl often used glue language tying together systems interfaces that were not specifically designed interoperate for data munging that converting processing large amounts data for tasks such creating reports fact these strengths are intimately linked combination makes perl popular all-purpose language for system administrators particularly because short programs often called one-liner programs can be entered run on single command line perl code can be made portable across windows unix such code often used by suppliers software both cots bespoke simplify packaging maintenance software build- deployment-scripts graphical user interfaces guis may be developed using perl for example perl/tk wxperl are commonly used enable user interaction with perl scripts such interaction may be synchronous asynchronous using callbacks update gui implementation perl implemented core interpreter written c together with large collection modules written perl c interpreter lines c code compiles mb executable on typical machine architectures alternatively interpreter can be compiled link library embedded other programs there are nearly modules distribution comprising lines perl additional lines c code much c code modules consists character encoding tables interpreter has object-oriented architecture all elements perl language—scalars arrays hashes coderefs file handles—are represented interpreter by c structs operations on these structs are defined by large collection macros typedefs functions these constitute perl c api perl api can be bewildering uninitiated but its entry points follow consistent naming scheme which provides guidance those who use life perl interpreter divides broadly into compile phase run phase perl phases are major stages interpreters life-cycle each interpreter goes through each phase only once phases follow fixed sequence most what happens perls compile phase compilation most what happens perls run phase execution but there are significant exceptions perl makes important use its capability execute perl code during compile phase perl will also delay compilation into run phase terms that indicate kind processing that actually occurring at any moment are compile time run time perl compile time at most points during compile phase but compile time may also be entered during run phase compile time for code string argument passed eval built-in occurs during run phase perl often run time during compile phase spends most run phase run time code begin blocks executes at run time but compile phase at compile time interpreter parses perl code into syntax tree at run time executes program by walking tree text parsed only once syntax tree subject optimization before executed so that execution relatively efficient compile-time optimizations on syntax tree include constant folding context propagation but peephole optimization also performed perl has turing-complete grammar because parsing can be affected by run-time code executed during compile phase therefore perl cannot be parsed by straight lex/yacc lexer/parser combination instead interpreter implements its own lexer which coordinates with modified gnu bison parser resolve ambiguities language often said that only perl can parse perl meaning that only perl interpreter perl can parse perl language perl but even this not general true because perl interpreter can simulate turing machine during its compile phase would need decide halting problem order complete parsing every case long-standing result that halting problem undecidable therefore not even perl can always parse perl perl makes unusual choice giving user access its full programming power its own compile phase cost terms theoretical purity high but practical inconvenience seems be rare other programs that undertake parse perl such source-code analyzers auto-indenters have contend not only with ambiguous syntactic constructs but also with undecidability perl parsing general case adam kennedys ppi project focused on parsing perl code document retaining its integrity document instead parsing perl executable code that not even perl itself can always do was kennedy who first conjectured that parsing perl suffers from halting problem  which was later proved perl distributed with over functional tests for core perl language over functional tests for core modules these run part normal build process extensively exercise interpreter its core modules perl developers rely on functional tests ensure that changes interpreter do not introduce software bugs additionally perl users who see that interpreter passes its functional tests on their system can have high degree confidence that working properly availability perl dual licensed under both artistic license gnu general public license distributions are available for most operating systems particularly prevalent on unix unix-like systems but has been ported most modern many obsolete platforms with only six reported exceptions perl can be compiled from source code on all posix-compliant otherwise-unix-compatible platforms because unusual changes required for classic mac os environment special port called macperl was shipped independently comprehensive perl archive network carries complete list supported platforms with links distributions available on each cpan also source for publicly available perl modules that are not part core perl distribution windows users microsoft windows typically install one native binary distributions perl for win32 most commonly strawberry perl activeperl compiling perl from source code under windows possible but most installations lack requisite c compiler build tools this also makes difficult install modules from cpan particularly those that are partially written c activeperl closed source distribution from activestate that has regular releases that track core perl releases distribution also includes perl package manager ppm popular tool for installing removing upgrading managing use common perl modules included also perlscript windows script host wsh engine implementing perl language visual perl activestate tool that adds perl visual studio net development suite strawberry perl open source distribution for windows has had regular quarterly releases since january including new modules feedback requests come strawberry perl aims be able install modules like standard perl distributions on other platforms including compiling xs modules cygwin emulation layer another way running perl under windows cygwin provides unix-like environment on windows both perl cpan are available standard pre-compiled packages cygwin setup program since cygwin also includes gcc compiling perl from source also possible perl executable included several windows resource kits directory with other scripting tools implementations perl come with mks toolkit uwin database interfaces perls text-handling capabilities can be used for generating sql queries arrays hashes automatic memory management make easy collect process returned data for example tim bunces perl dbi application programming interface api arguments api can be text sql queries thus possible program multiple languages at same time eg for generating web page using html javascript sql here document use perl variable interpolation programmatically customize each sql queries specification perl arrays hashes structures programmatically hold resulting data sets from each sql query allows high-level mechanism for handling large amounts data for post-processing by perl subprogram early versions perl database interfaces were created by relinking interpreter with client-side database library this was sufficiently difficult that was done for only few most-important most widely used databases restricted resulting perl executable using just one database interface at time perl database interfaces are implemented by perl dbi modules dbi database interface module presents single database-independent interface perl applications while dbd database driver modules handle details accessing some different databases there are dbd drivers for most ansi sql databases dbi provides caching for database handles queries which can greatly improve performance long-lived execution environments such mod perl helping high-volume systems avert load spikes slashdot effect modern perl applications especially those written using web frameworks such catalyst dbi module often used indirectly via object-relational mappers such dbixclass classdbi rosedbobject that generate sql queries handle data transparently application author comparative performance computer language benchmarks game project hosted by alioth compares performance implementations typical programming problems several programming languages submitted perl implementations typically perform toward high end memory-usage spectrum give varied speed results perls performance benchmarks game typical for interpreted languages large perl programs start more slowly than similar programs compiled languages because perl has compile source every time runs talk at yapceurope conference subsequent article timely start jean-louis leroy found that his perl programs took much longer run than expected because perl interpreter spent significant time finding modules within his over-large include path unlike java python ruby perl has only experimental support for pre-compiling therefore perl programs pay this overhead penalty on every execution run phase typical programs long enough that amortized startup time not substantial but benchmarks that measure very short execution times are likely be skewed due this overhead number tools have been introduced improve this situation first such tool was apaches mod perl which sought address one most-common reasons that small perl programs were invoked rapidly cgi web development activeperl via microsoft isapi provides similar performance improvements once perl code compiled there additional overhead during execution phase that typically isnt present for programs written compiled languages such c c++ examples such overhead include bytecode interpretation reference-counting memory management dynamic type-checking optimizing because perl interpreted language can give problems when efficiency critical such situations most critical routines can be written other languages such c which can be connected perl via simple inline modules more complex but flexible xs mechanism perl main article perl camelia logo for perl project at perl conference jon orwant made case for major new language-initiative this led decision begin work on redesign language be called perl proposals for new language features were solicited from perl community at large which submitted more than rfcs wall spent next few years digesting rfcs synthesizing them into coherent framework for perl he has presented his design for perl series documents called apocalypses - numbered correspond chapters programming perl january developing specification perl encapsulated design documents called synopses - numbered correspond apocalypses perl not intended be backward compatible although there will be compatibility mode perl perl are distinct languages with common ancestry thesis work by bradley m kuhn overseen by wall considered possible use java virtual machine runtime for perl kuhns thesis showed this approach be problematic was decided that perl would run on cross-language virtual machine called parrot this will mean that other languages targeting parrot will gain native access cpan allowing some level cross-language development audrey tang created pugs project implementation perl haskell this acted continues act test platform for perl language separate from development actual implementation - allowing language designers explore pugs project spawned active perl/haskell cross-language community centered around freenode perl6 irc channel number features perl language show similarities haskell perl development centers primarily around two compilers rakudo perl implementation running on parrot virtual machine java virtual machine developers are also working on moarvm c language-based virtual machine designed specifically for rakudo niecza which targets common language runtime future perl development perl also continuing perl was released april with some new features influenced by design perl followed by perl released on june perl released on august perl released on may perl development versions are released on monthly basis with major releases coming out once per year future plans for perl include making core language easier extend from modules providing small extensible meta-object protocol core relative proportion internet searches for perl programming compared with similar searches for other programming languages steadily declined from about 10% about 2% has remained around 2% level since perl community perls culture community has developed alongside language itself usenet was first public venue which perl was introduced but over course its evolution perls community was shaped by growth broadening internet-based services including introduction world wide web community that surrounds perl was fact topic walls first state onion talk state onion state onion name for wall’s yearly keynote-style summaries on progress perl its community they are characterized by his hallmark humor employing references perl’s culture wider hacker

example code older versions perl one would write hello world program print hello world\n later versions which support say statement one can also write use say hello world good perl practices require more complex programs add use strict use warnings pragmas leading into something like use strict use warnings print hello world\n here more complex perl program that counts down seconds up given threshold /usr/bin/perl use strict use warnings use iohandle my $remaining $total $remaining = $total = shift@argv stdout->autoflush1 while $remaining { printf remaining %s/%s \r $remaining-- $total sleep } print \n perl interpreter can also be used for one-off scripts on command line following example invoked from sh-compatible shell such bash translates string bob all files ending with txt current directory robert $ perl -ibak -lp -e s/bob/robert/g txt criticism perl has been referred line noise by some programmers who claim its syntax makes write-only language earliest such mention was first edition book learning perl perl tutorial book written by randal l schwartz first chapter which he states yes sometimes perl looks like line noise uninitiated but seasoned perl programmer looks like checksummed line noise with mission life he also stated that accusation that perl write-only language could be avoided by coding with proper care perl overview document perlintro states that names built-in magic scalar variables look like punctuation line noise perlstyle document states that line noise regular expressions could be mitigated using /x modifier add whitespace according perl faq perl was designed mitigate usual suspects that elicit line noise claim from perl critics including removal majority punctuation variables sanitization regex syntax perl faq also states that what sometimes referred perls line noise actual syntax language just gerunds prepositions are part english language december blog posting despite claiming that rakudo perl has failed will continue fail unless gets some adult supervision chromatic stated that design perl has well-defined grammar well improved type system unified object system with intelligent metamodel metaoperators clearer system context that provides for such niceties pervasive laziness he also stated that perl has coherence consistency that perl lacks see also free software portal computer programming portal outline perl

converting source code create executable program name compiler primarily used for programs that translate source code from high-level programming language lower level language eg assembly language machine code if compiled program can run on computer whose cpu operating system different from one on which compiler runs compiler known cross-compiler more generally compilers are specific type translator while all programs that take set programming specifications translate them ie create means execute those specifications are technically compilers term generally means program that produces separate executable from compiler that may require run time library subsystem operate compiler that merely executes original specifications usually referred interpreter although because differing methods analyzing what represents compilation what represents interpretation there some overlap between two terms program that translates from low level language higher level one decompiler program

references external links history main article history compiler construction diagram operation typical multi-language multi-target compiler software for early computers was primarily written assembly language although first high level language nearly old first computer limited memory capacity early computers led substantial technical challenges when first compilers were designed first high-level programming language plankalkül was proposed by konrad zuse first compiler was written by grace hopper for a-0 programming language a-0 functioned more loader linker than modern notion compiler first autocode its compiler were developed by alick glennie for mark computer at university manchester considered by some be first compiled programming language fortran team led by john backus at ibm generally credited having introduced first complete compiler cobol was early language be compiled on multiple architectures many application domains idea using higher level language quickly caught on because expanding functionality supported by newer programming languages increasing complexity computer architectures compilers have become more complex early compilers were written assembly language first self-hosting compiler – capable compiling its own source code high-level language – was created for lisp by tim hart mike levin at mit since 1970s has become common practice implement compiler language compiles although both pascal c have been popular choices for implementation language building self-hosting compiler bootstrapping problem—the first such compiler for language must be compiled either by hand by compiler written different language hart levins lisp compiler compiled by running compiler interpreter compilation compilers enabled development programs that are machine-independent before development fortran first high-level language 1950s machine-dependent assembly language was widely used while assembly language produces more abstraction than machine code on same architecture just with machine code has be modified rewritten if program be executed on different computer hardware architecture with advent high-level programming languages that followed fortran such cobol c basic programmers could write machine-independent source programs compiler translates high-level source programs into target programs machine languages for specific hardware once target program generated user can execute program compilers education compiler construction compiler optimization are taught at universities schools part computer science curriculum such courses are usually supplemented with implementation compiler for educational programming language well-documented example niklaus wirths pl/0 compiler which wirth used teach compiler construction 1970s spite its simplicity pl/0 compiler introduced several influential concepts field program development by stepwise refinement also title paper by wirth use recursive descent parser use extended backus–naur form ebnf specify syntax language code generator producing portable p-code use tombstone diagrams formal description bootstrapping problem compiler output this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed may learn how when remove this template message one classification compilers by platform on which their generated code executes this known target platform native hosted compiler one which output intended directly run on same type computer operating system that compiler itself runs on output cross compiler designed run on different platform cross compilers are often used when developing software for embedded systems that are not intended support software development environment output compiler that produces code for virtual machine vm may may not be executed on same platform compiler that produced for this reason such compilers are not usually classified native cross compilers lower level language that target compiler may itself be high-level programming language c often viewed some sort portable assembler can also be target language compiler eg cfront original compiler for c++ used c target language c created by such compiler usually not intended be read maintained by humans so indent style pretty c intermediate code are irrelevant some features c turn into good target language eg c code with line directives can be generated support debugging original source compiled versus interpreted languages higher-level programming languages usually appear with type translation mind either designed compiled language interpreted language however practice there rarely anything about language that requires be exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted although possible design languages that rely on re-interpretation at run time categorization usually reflects most popular widespread implementations language — for instance basic sometimes called interpreted language c compiled one despite existence basic compilers c interpreters interpretation does not replace compilation completely only hides from user makes gradual even though interpreter can itself be interpreted directly executed program needed somewhere at bottom stack see machine language modern trends toward just-in-time compilation bytecode interpretation at times blur traditional categorizations compilers interpreters some language specifications spell out that implementations must include compilation facility for example common lisp however there nothing inherent definition common lisp that stops from being interpreted other languages have features that are very easy implement interpreter but make writing compiler much harder for example apl snobol4 many scripting languages allow programs construct arbitrary source code at runtime with regular string operations then execute that code by passing special evaluation function implement these features compiled language programs must usually be shipped with runtime library that includes version compiler itself special type compilers while typical compiler outputs machine code there are several other types source-to-source compiler type compiler that takes high level language its input outputs high level language for example automatic parallelizing compiler will frequently take high level language program input then transform code annotate with parallel code annotations eg openmp language constructs eg fortrans doall statements bytecode compilers that compile assembly language theoretical machine like some prolog implementations o this prolog machine also known warren abstract machine wam o bytecode compilers for java python are also examples this category just-in-time compiler jit compiler last part multi-pass compiler chain which some compilation stages are deferred run-time examples are implemented smalltalk java microsoft nets common intermediate language cil systems o applications are first compiled using bytecode compiler delivered machine-independent intermediate representation this bytecode then compiled using jit compiler native machine code just when execution program required hardware compilers also known syntheses tools are compilers whose output description hardware configuration instead sequence instructions o output these compilers target computer hardware at very low level for example field-programmable gate array fpga structured application-specific integrated circuit asic such compilers are said be hardware compilers because source code they compile effectively controls final configuration hardware how operates output compilation only interconnection transistors lookup tables o example hardware compiler xst xilinx synthesis tool used for configuring fpgas

reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed september learn how when remove this template message compilers bridge source programs high-level languages with underlying hardware compiler verifies code syntax generates efficient object code performs run-time organization formats output according assembler linker conventions early days approach taken compiler design used be directly affected by complexity processing experience persons designing resources available compiler for relatively simple language written by one person might be single monolithic piece software when source language large complex high quality output required design may be split into number relatively independent phases having separate phases means development can be parceled up into small parts given different people also becomes much easier replace single phase by improved one insert new phases later eg additional optimizations division compilation processes into phases was championed by production quality compiler-compiler project pqcc at carnegie mellon university this project introduced terms front end middle end back end all but smallest compilers have more than two phases point at which these ends meet not always clearly defined one-pass versus multi-pass compilers classifying compilers by number passes has its background hardware resource limitations computers compiling involves performing lots work early computers did not have enough memory contain one program that did all this work so compilers were split up into smaller programs which each made pass over source some representation performing some required analysis translations ability compile single pass has classically been seen benefit because simplifies job writing compiler one-pass compilers generally perform compilations faster than multi-pass compilers thus partly driven by resource limitations early systems many early languages were specifically designed so that they could be compiled single pass eg pascal some cases design language feature may require compiler perform more than one pass over source for instance consider declaration appearing on line source which affects translation statement appearing on line this case first pass needs gather information about declarations appearing after statements that they affect with actual translation happening during subsequent pass disadvantage compiling single pass that not possible perform many sophisticated optimizations needed generate high quality code can be difficult count exactly how many passes optimizing compiler makes for instance different phases optimization may analyse one expression many times but only analyse another expression once splitting compiler up into small programs technique used by researchers interested producing provably correct compilers proving correctness set small programs often requires less effort than proving correctness larger single equivalent program three phases compiler structure regardless exact number stages which compiler built common practice classify them into three phases these phases are named after production quality compiler-compiler project phases mentioned before compiler design front end verifies syntax semantics according specific source language performs type checking by collecting type information generates errors warnings if any highlighting them on source code aspects front end include lexical analysis syntax analysis semantic analysis eventually generates intermediate representation ir source code for processing by middle-end this ir usually lower level representation program with respect source code middle end performs optimizations on form other than source code machine code this source code/machine code independence intended enable generic optimizations be shared between versions compiler supporting different languages target processors examples middle end optimizations are removal useless unreachable code discovery propagation constant values relocation computation less frequently executed place eg out loop specialization computation based on context eventually may generate another ir for be used back end back end takes output from middle end may perform more analysis transformations optimizations that are for particular computer generates target-dependent assembly code performing register allocation process performs optimizations target code utilization hardware like figuring out how keep parallel execution units busy by filling delay slots although most algorithms for optimization are np-hard heuristic techniques are well-developed currently implemented production-quality compilers typically output back end machine code specialized for particular processor operating system this front/middle/back-end approach makes possible combine front ends for different languages with back ends for different cpus practical examples this approach are gnu compiler collection llvm amsterdam compiler kit which have multiple front-ends shared analysis multiple back-ends front end lexer parser example for c starting from sequence characters ifnet>00total+=net10+tax/1000 scanner composes sequence tokens categorizes each them for example identifier reserved word number literal operator latter sequence transformed by parser into syntax tree which then treated by remaining compiler phases scanner parser handles regular properly context-free parts grammar for c respectively compiler frontend analyzes source code build internal representation program called intermediate representation ir also manages symbol table data structure mapping each symbol source code associated information such location type scope while frontend can be single monolithic function program scannerless parser more commonly implemented analyzed several phases which may execute sequentially concurrently this method favored due its modularity separation concerns most commonly today frontend broken into three phases lexical analysis also known lexing syntax analysis also known parsing semantic analysis lexical analysis parsing comprise syntactic analysis word syntax phrase syntax respectively simple cases these modules lexer parser can be automatically generated from grammar for language though more complex cases these require manual modification lexical grammar phrase grammar are usually context-free grammars which simplifies analysis significantly with context-sensitivity handled at semantic analysis phase semantic analysis phase generally more complex written by hand but can be partially fully automated using attribute grammars these phases themselves can be further broken down – lexing scanning evaluating parsing first building concrete syntax tree cst parse tree then transforming into abstract syntax tree ast syntax tree some cases additional phases are used notably line reconstruction preprocessing but these are rare detailed list possible phases includes line reconstruction languages which strop their keywords allow arbitrary spaces within identifiers require phase before parsing which converts input character sequence canonical form ready for parser top-down recursive-descent table-driven parsers used 1960s typically read source one character at time did not require separate tokenizing phase atlas autocode imp some implementations algol coral are examples stropped languages which compilers would have line reconstruction phase lexical analysis breaks source code text into small pieces called tokens each token single atomic unit language for instance keyword identifier symbol name token syntax typically regular language so finite state automaton constructed from regular expression can be used recognize this phase also called lexing scanning software doing lexical analysis called lexical analyzer scanner this may not be separate step – can be combined with parsing step scannerless parsing which case parsing done at character level not token level preprocessing some languages eg c require preprocessing phase which supports macro substitution conditional compilation typically preprocessing phase occurs before syntactic semantic analysis eg case c preprocessor manipulates lexical tokens rather than syntactic forms however some languages such scheme support macro substitutions based on syntactic forms syntax analysis involves parsing token sequence identify syntactic structure program this phase typically builds parse tree which replaces linear sequence tokens with tree structure built according rules formal grammar which define languages syntax parse tree often analyzed augmented transformed by later phases compiler semantic analysis phase which compiler adds semantic information parse tree builds symbol table this phase performs semantic checks such type checking checking for type errors object binding associating variable function references with their definitions definite assignment requiring all local variables be initialized before use rejecting incorrect programs issuing warnings semantic analysis usually requires complete parse tree meaning that this phase logically follows parsing phase logically precedes code generation phase though often possible fold multiple phases into one pass over code compiler implementation back end term back end sometimes confused with code generator because overlapped functionality generating assembly code some literature uses middle end distinguish generic analysis optimization phases back end from machine-dependent code generators main phases back end include following analysis this gathering program information from intermediate representation derived from input data-flow analysis used build use-define chains together with dependence analysis alias analysis pointer analysis escape analysis etc accurate analysis basis for any compiler optimization call graph control flow graph are usually also built during analysis phase optimization intermediate language representation transformed into functionally equivalent but faster smaller forms popular optimizations are inline expansion dead code elimination constant propagation loop transformation register allocation even automatic parallelization code generation transformed intermediate language translated into output language usually native machine language system this involves resource storage decisions such deciding which variables fit into registers memory selection scheduling appropriate machine instructions along with their associated addressing modes see also sethi-ullman algorithm debug data may also need be generated facilitate debugging compiler analysis prerequisite for any compiler optimization they tightly work together for example dependence analysis crucial for loop transformation addition scope compiler analysis optimizations vary greatly from small basic block procedure/function level even over whole program interprocedural optimization obviously compiler can potentially do better job using broader view but that broad view not free large scope analysis optimizations are very costly terms compilation time memory space this especially true for interprocedural analysis optimizations interprocedural analysis optimizations are common modern commercial compilers from hp ibm sgi intel microsoft sun microsystems open source gcc was criticized for long time for lacking powerful interprocedural optimizations but changing this respect another open source compiler with full analysis optimization infrastructure open64 which used by many organizations for research commercial purposes due extra time space needed for compiler analysis optimizations some compilers skip them by default users have use compilation options explicitly tell compiler which optimizations

programming at wikibooks c /ˈsiː/ letter c general-purpose imperative computer programming language supporting structured programming lexical variable scope recursion while static type system prevents many unintended operations by design c provides constructs that map efficiently typical machine instructions therefore has found lasting use applications that had formerly been coded assembly language including operating systems well various application software for computers ranging from supercomputers embedded systems c was originally developed by dennis ritchie between at bell labs used re-implement unix operating system has since become one most widely used programming languages all time with c compilers from various vendors available for majority existing computer architectures

procedural language was designed be compiled using relatively straightforward compiler provide low-level access memory provide language constructs that map efficiently machine instructions require minimal run-time support therefore c was useful for many applications that had formerly been coded assembly language for example system programming despite its low-level capabilities language was designed encourage cross-platform programming standards-compliant portably written c program can be compiled for very wide variety computer platforms operating systems with few changes its source code language has become available on very wide range platforms from embedded microcontrollers supercomputers overview like most imperative languages algol tradition c has facilities for structured programming allows lexical variable scope recursion while static type system prevents many unintended operations c all executable code contained within subroutines which are called functions although not strict sense functional programming function parameters are always passed by value pass-by-reference simulated c by explicitly passing pointer values c program source text free-format using semicolon statement terminator curly braces for grouping blocks statements c language also exhibits following characteristics there small fixed number keywords including full set flow control primitives for if/else while switch do/while user-defined names are not distinguished from keywords by any kind sigil there are large number arithmetical logical operators such + += ++ & ~ etc more than one assignment may be performed single statement function return values can be ignored when not needed typing static but weakly enforced all data has type but implicit conversions may be performed declaration syntax mimics usage context c has no define keyword instead statement beginning with name type taken declaration there no function keyword instead function indicated by parentheses argument list user-defined typedef compound types are possible o heterogeneous aggregate data types struct allow related data elements be accessed assigned unit o array indexing secondary notation defined terms pointer arithmetic unlike structs arrays are not first-class objects they cannot be assigned compared using single built-in operators there no array keyword use definition instead square brackets indicate arrays syntactically for example month o enumerated types are possible with enum keyword they are not tagged are freely interconvertible with integers o strings are not separate data type but are conventionally implemented null-terminated arrays characters low-level access computer memory possible by converting machine addresses typed pointers procedures subroutines not returning values are special case function with untyped return type void functions may not be defined within lexical scope other functions function data pointers permit ad hoc run-time polymorphism preprocessor performs macro definition source code file inclusion conditional compilation there basic form modularity files can be compiled separately linked together with control over

developments ken thompson left with dennis ritchie right inventor c programming language origin c closely tied development unix operating system originally implemented assembly language on pdp-7 by ritchie thompson incorporating several ideas from colleagues eventually they decided port operating system pdp-11 original pdp-11 version unix was developed assembly language developers were considering rewriting system using b language thompsons simplified version bcpl however bs inability take advantage some pdp-11s features notably byte addressability led c name c was chosen simply next after b development c started on pdp-11 unix system first appeared version unix language was not initially designed with portability mind but soon ran on different platforms well compiler for honeywell was written within first year cs history while ibm system/370 port followed soon also large part unix was rewritten c by with addition struct types c language had become powerful enough that most unixs kernel was now c unix was one first operating system kernels implemented language other than assembly earlier instances include multics system which was written pl/i master control program mcp for burroughs b5000 written algol around ritchie stephen c johnson made further changes language facilitate portability unix operating system johnsons portable c compiler served basis for several implementations c on new platforms k&r c cover book c programming language first edition by brian kernighan dennis ritchie brian kernighan dennis ritchie published first edition c programming language this book known c programmers k&r served for many years informal specification language version c that describes commonly referred k&r c second edition book covers later ansi c standard described below k&r introduced several language features standard i/o library long int data type unsigned int data type compound assignment operators form =op such =- were changed form op= that -= remove semantic ambiguity created by constructs such i=-10 which had been interpreted i =- decrement i by instead possibly intended i = let i be even after publication ansi standard for many years k&r c was still considered lowest common denominator which c programmers restricted themselves when maximum portability was desired since many older compilers were still use because carefully written k&r c code can be legal standard c well early versions c only functions that return types other than int must be declared if used before function definition functions used without prior declaration were presumed return type int for example long somefunction / int / otherfunction / int / callingfunction { long test1 register / int / test2 test1 = somefunction if test1 > test2 = else test2 = otherfunction return test2 } int type specifiers which are commented out could be omitted k&r c but are required later standards since k&r function declarations did not include any information about function arguments function parameter type checks were not performed although some compilers would issue warning message if local function was called with wrong number arguments if multiple calls external function used different numbers types arguments separate tools such unixs lint utility were developed that among other things could check for consistency function use across multiple source files years following publication k&r c several features were added language supported by compilers from at&t particular pcc some other vendors these included void functions ie functions with no return value functions returning struct union types rather than pointers assignment for struct data types enumerated types large number extensions lack agreement on standard library together with language popularity fact that not even unix compilers precisely implemented k&r specification led necessity standardization ansi c iso c main article ansi c cover book c programming language second edition by brian kernighan dennis ritchie covering ansi c during late 1970s 1980s versions c were implemented for wide variety mainframe computers minicomputers microcomputers including ibm pc its popularity began increase significantly american national standards institute ansi formed committee x3j11 establish standard specification c x3j11 based c standard on unix implementation however non-portable portion unix c library was handed off ieee working group become basis for posix standard c standard was ratified ansi x3159-1989 programming language c this version language often referred ansi c standard c sometimes c89 ansi c standard with formatting changes was adopted by international organization for standardization iso iso/iec which sometimes called c90 therefore terms c89 c90 refer same programming language ansi like other national standards bodies no longer develops c standard independently but defers international c standard maintained by working group iso/iec jtc1/sc22/wg14 national adoption update international standard typically occurs within year iso publication one aims c standardization process was produce superset k&r c incorporating many subsequently introduced unofficial features standards committee also included several additional features such function prototypes borrowed from c++ void pointers support for international character sets locales preprocessor enhancements although syntax for parameter declarations was augmented include style used c++ k&r interface continued be permitted for compatibility with existing source code c89 supported by current c compilers most c code being written today based on any program written only standard c without any hardware-dependent assumptions will run correctly on any platform with conforming c implementation within its resource limits without such precautions programs may compile only on certain platform with particular compiler due for example use non-standard libraries such gui libraries reliance on compiler- platform-specific attributes such exact size data types byte endianness cases where code must be compilable by either standard-conforming k&r c-based compilers stdc macro can be used split code into standard k&r sections prevent use on k&r c-based compiler features available only standard c after ansi/iso standardization process c language specification remained relatively static for several years normative amendment c standard iso/iec 9899/amd11995 known informally c95 was published correct some details add more extensive support for international character sets c99 main article c99 c standard was further revised late 1990s leading publication iso/iec which commonly referred c99 has since been amended three times by technical corrigenda c99 introduced several new features including inline functions several new data types including long long int complex type represent complex numbers variable-length arrays flexible array members improved support for ieee floating point support for variadic macros macros variable arity support for one-line comments beginning with // bcpl c++ many these had already been implemented extensions several c compilers c99 for most part backward compatible with c90 but stricter some ways particular declaration that lacks type specifier no longer has int implicitly assumed standard macro stdcversion defined with value 199901l indicate that c99 support available gcc solaris studio other c compilers now support many all new features c99 c compiler microsoft visual c++ however implements c89 standard those parts c99 that are required for compatibility with c++11 c11 main article c11 c standard revision work began on another revision c standard informally called c1x until its official publication on c standards committee adopted guidelines limit adoption new features that had not been tested by existing implementations c11 standard adds numerous new features c library including type generic macros anonymous structures improved unicode support atomic operations multi-threading bounds-checked functions also makes some portions existing c99 library optional improves compatibility with c++ standard macro stdcversion defined 201112l indicate that c11 support available embedded c main article embedded c historically embedded c programming requires nonstandard extensions c language order support exotic features such fixed-point arithmetic multiple distinct memory banks basic i/o operations c standards committee published technical report extending c language address these issues by providing common standard for all implementations adhere includes number features not available normal c such fixed-point arithmetic named address spaces basic i/o hardware addressing syntax main article c syntax c has formal grammar specified by c standard line endings are generally not significant c however line boundaries do have significance during preprocessing phase comments may appear either between delimiters / / since c99 following // until end line comments delimited by / / do not nest these sequences characters are not interpreted comment delimiters if they appear inside string character literals c source files contain declarations function definitions function definitions turn contain declarations statements declarations either define new types using keywords such struct union enum assign types perhaps reserve storage for new variables usually by writing type followed by variable name keywords such char int specify built-in types sections code are enclosed braces { } sometimes called curly brackets limit scope declarations act single statement for control structures imperative language c uses statements specify actions most common statement expression statement consisting expression be evaluated followed by semicolon side effect evaluation functions may be called variables may be assigned new values modify normal sequential execution statements c provides several control-flow statements identified by reserved keywords structured programming supported by if-else conditional execution by do- while while for iterative execution looping for statement has separate initialization testing reinitialization expressions any all which can be omitted break continue can be used leave innermost enclosing loop statement skip its reinitialization there also non-structured goto statement which branches directly designated label within function switch selects case be executed based on value integer expression expressions can use variety built-in operators may contain function calls order which arguments functions operands most operators are evaluated unspecified evaluations may even be interleaved however all side effects including storage variables will occur before next sequence point sequence points include end each expression statement entry return from each function call sequence points also occur during evaluation expressions containing certain operators && || comma operator this permits high degree object code optimization by compiler but requires c programmers take more care obtain reliable results than needed for other programming languages kernighan ritchie say introduction c programming language c like any other language has its blemishes some operators have wrong precedence some parts syntax could be better c standard did not attempt correct many these blemishes because impact such changes on already existing software character set basic c source character set includes following characters lowercase uppercase letters iso basic latin alphabet a–z a–z decimal digits 0–9 graphic characters % &  + - / { | } ~ whitespace characters space horizontal tab vertical tab form feed newline newline indicates end text line need not correspond actual single character although for convenience c treats one additional multi-byte encoded characters may be used string literals but they are not entirely portable latest c standard c11 allows multi-national unicode characters be embedded portably within c source text by using \uxxxx \uxxxxxxxx encoding where x denotes hexadecimal character although this feature not yet widely implemented basic c execution character set contains same characters along with representations for alert backspace carriage return run-time support for extended character sets has increased with each revision c standard reserved words c89 has reserved words also known keywords which are words that cannot be used for any purposes other than those for which they are predefined auto break case char const continue default do double else enum extern float for goto if int long register return short signed sizeof static struct switch typedef union unsigned void volatile while c99 reserved five more words bool complex imaginary inline restrict c11 reserved seven more words alignas alignof atomic generic noreturn staticassert threadlocal most recently reserved words begin with underscore followed by capital letter because identifiers that form were previously reserved by c standard for use only by implementations since existing program source code should not have been using these identifiers would not be affected when c implementations started supporting these extensions programming language some standard headers do define more convenient synonyms for underscored identifiers language previously included reserved word called entry but this was seldom implemented has now been removed reserved word operators main article operators c c++ c supports rich set operators which are symbols used within expression specify manipulations be performed while evaluating that expression c has operators for arithmetic + - / % assignment = augmented assignment += -= = /= %= &= |= ^= >= bitwise logic ~ & | bitwise shifts > boolean logic && || conditional evaluation equality testing == = calling functions increment decrement ++ -- member selection -> object size sizeof order relations >= reference dereference & sequencing subexpression grouping type conversion typename c uses operator = used mathematics express equality indicate assignment following precedent fortran pl/i but unlike algol its derivatives c uses operator == test for equality similarity between these two operators assignment equality may result accidental use one place other many cases mistake does not produce error message although some compilers produce warnings for example conditional expression ifa==b+1 might mistakenly be written ifa=b+1 which will be evaluated true if not zero after assignment c operator precedence not always intuitive for example operator == binds more tightly than executed prior operators & bitwise | bitwise expressions such x & == which must be written x & == if that

weakly typed which makes similar type system algol descendants such pascal there are built-in types for integers various sizes both signed unsigned floating-point numbers enumerated types enum integer type char often used for single-byte characters c99 added boolean datatype there are also derived types including arrays pointers records struct untagged unions union c often used low-level systems programming where escapes from type system may be necessary compiler attempts ensure type correctness most expressions but programmer can override checks various ways either by using type cast explicitly convert value from one type another by using pointers unions reinterpret underlying bits data object some other way some find cs declaration syntax unintuitive particularly for function pointers ritchies idea was declare identifiers contexts resembling their use declaration reflects use cs usual arithmetic conversions allow for efficient code be generated but can sometimes produce unexpected results for example comparison signed unsigned integers equal width requires conversion signed value unsigned this can generate unexpected results if signed value negative pointers c supports use pointers type reference that records address location object function memory pointers can be dereferenced access data stored at address pointed invoke pointed-to function pointers can be manipulated using assignment pointer arithmetic run-time representation pointer value typically raw memory address perhaps augmented by offset-within-word field but since pointers type includes type thing pointed expressions including pointers can be type-checked at compile time pointer arithmetic automatically scaled by size pointed-to data type pointers are used for many purposes c text strings are commonly manipulated using pointers into arrays characters dynamic memory allocation performed using pointers many data types such trees are commonly implemented dynamically allocated struct objects linked together using pointers pointers functions are useful for passing functions arguments higher-order functions such qsort bsearch callbacks be invoked by event handlers null pointer value explicitly points no valid location dereferencing null pointer value undefined often resulting segmentation fault null pointer values are useful for indicating special cases such no next pointer final node linked list error indication from functions returning pointers appropriate contexts source code such for assigning pointer variable null pointer constant can be written with without explicit casting pointer type null macro defined by several standard headers conditional contexts null pointer values evaluate false while all other pointer values evaluate true void pointers void point objects unspecified type can therefore be used generic data pointers since size type pointed-to object not known void pointers cannot be dereferenced nor pointer arithmetic on them allowed although they can easily be many contexts implicitly are converted from any other object pointer type careless use pointers potentially dangerous because they are typically unchecked pointer variable can be made point any arbitrary location which can cause undesirable effects although properly used pointers point safe places they can be made point unsafe places by using invalid pointer arithmetic objects they point may continue be used after deallocation dangling pointers they may be used without having been initialized wild pointers they may be directly assigned unsafe value using cast union through another corrupt pointer general c permissive allowing manipulation conversion between pointer types although compilers typically provide options for various levels checking some other programming languages address these problems by using more restrictive reference types arrays see also c string array types c are traditionally fixed static size specified at compile time more recent c99 standard also allows form variable-length arrays however also possible allocate block memory arbitrary size at run-time using standard librarys malloc function treat array cs unification arrays pointers means that declared arrays these dynamically allocated simulated arrays are virtually interchangeable since arrays are always accessed effect via pointers array accesses are typically not checked against underlying array size although some compilers may provide bounds checking option array bounds violations are therefore possible rather common carelessly written code can lead various repercussions including illegal memory accesses corruption data buffer overruns run-time exceptions if bounds checking desired must be done manually c does not have special provision for declaring multi-dimensional arrays but rather relies on recursion within type system declare arrays arrays which effectively accomplishes same thing index values resulting multi-dimensional array can be thought increasing row-major order multi-dimensional arrays are commonly used numerical algorithms mainly from applied linear algebra store matrices structure c array well suited this particular task however since arrays are passed merely pointers bounds array must be known fixed values else explicitly passed any subroutine that requires them dynamically sized arrays arrays cannot be accessed using double indexing workaround for this allocate array with additional row vector pointers columns c99 introduced variable-length arrays which address some but not all issues with ordinary c arrays array–pointer interchangeability subscript notation x where x designates pointer syntactic sugar for x+i taking advantage compilers knowledge pointer type address that x + i points not base address pointed by x incremented by i bytes but rather defined be base address incremented by i multiplied by size element that x points thus x designates i+1th element array furthermore most expression contexts notable exception operand sizeof name array automatically converted pointer arrays first element this implies that array never copied whole when named argument function but rather only address its first element passed therefore although function calls c use pass-by-value semantics arrays are effect passed by reference size element can be determined by applying operator sizeof any dereferenced element x n = sizeof x n = sizeof x number elements declared array can be determined sizeof / sizeof latter only applies array names variables declared with subscripts int due semantics c not possible determine entire size arrays through pointers arrays those created by dynamic allocation malloc code such sizeof arr / sizeof arr where arr designates pointer will not work since compiler assumes size pointer itself being requested since array name arguments sizeof are not converted pointers they do not exhibit such ambiguity however arrays created by dynamic allocation are accessed by pointers rather than true array variables so they suffer from same sizeof issues array pointers thus despite this apparent equivalence between array pointer variables there still distinction be made between them even though name array most expression contexts converted into pointer its first element this pointer does not itself occupy any storage array name not l-value its address constant unlike pointer variable consequently what array points cannot be changed impossible assign new address array name array contents may be copied however by using memcpy function by accessing individual elements memory management one most important functions programming language provide facilities for managing memory objects that are stored memory c provides three distinct ways allocate memory for objects static memory allocation space for object provided binary at compile-time these objects have extent lifetime long binary which contains them loaded into memory automatic memory allocation temporary objects can be stored on stack this space automatically freed reusable after block which they are declared exited dynamic memory allocation blocks memory arbitrary size can be requested at run-time using library functions such malloc from region memory called heap these blocks persist until subsequently freed for reuse by calling library function realloc free these three approaches are appropriate different situations have various trade-offs for example static memory allocation has little allocation overhead automatic allocation may involve slightly more overhead dynamic memory allocation can potentially have great deal overhead for both allocation deallocation persistent nature static objects useful for maintaining state information across function calls automatic allocation easy use but stack space typically much more limited transient than either static memory heap space dynamic memory allocation allows convenient allocation objects whose size known only at run-time most c programs make extensive use all three where possible automatic static allocation usually simplest because storage managed by compiler freeing programmer potentially error-prone chore manually allocating releasing storage however many data structures can change size at runtime since static allocations automatic allocations before c99 must have fixed size at compile-time there are many situations which dynamic allocation necessary prior c99 standard variable-sized arrays were common example this see article on malloc for example dynamically allocated arrays unlike automatic allocation which can fail at run time with uncontrolled consequences dynamic allocation functions return indication form null pointer value when required storage cannot be allocated static allocation that too large usually detected by linker loader before program can even begin execution unless otherwise specified static objects contain zero null pointer values upon program startup automatically dynamically allocated objects are initialized only if initial value explicitly specified otherwise they initially have indeterminate values typically whatever bit pattern happens be present storage which might not even represent valid value for that type if program attempts access uninitialized value results are undefined many modern compilers try detect warn about this problem but both false positives false negatives can occur another issue that heap memory allocation has be synchronized with its actual usage any program order for be reused much possible for example if only pointer heap memory allocation goes out scope has its value overwritten before free called then that memory cannot be recovered for later reuse essentially lost program phenomenon known memory leak conversely possible for memory be freed but continue be referenced leading unpredictable results typically symptoms will appear portion program far removed from actual error making difficult track down problem such issues are ameliorated languages with automatic garbage collection libraries c programming language uses libraries its primary method extension c library set functions contained within single archive file each library typically has header file which contains prototypes functions contained within library that may be used by program declarations special data types macro symbols used with these functions order for program use library must include librarys header file library must be linked with program which many cases requires compiler flags eg -lm shorthand for link math library most common c library c standard library which specified by iso ansi c standards comes with every c implementation implementations which target limited environments such embedded systems may provide only subset standard library this library supports stream input output memory allocation mathematics character strings time values several separate standard headers for example stdioh specify interfaces for these other

non-strict functional languages functions language constructs exist achieve same result but they are not necessarily called control flow statements set statements turn generally structured block which addition grouping also defines lexical scope interrupts signals are low-level mechanisms that can alter flow control way similar subroutine but usually occur response some external stimulus event that can occur asynchronously rather than execution in-line control flow statement at level machine assembly language control flow instructions usually work by altering program counter for some cpus only

different languages vary but can be categorized by their effect continuation at different statement unconditional branch jump executing set statements only if some condition met choice - ie conditional branch executing set statements zero more times until some condition met ie loop - same conditional branch executing set distant statements after which flow control usually returns subroutines coroutines continuations stopping program preventing any further execution unconditional halt primitives labels main article label computer science label explicit name number assigned fixed position within source code which may be referenced by control flow statements appearing elsewhere source code other than marking position within source code label has no effect line numbers are alternative named label used some languages such fortran basic that are whole numbers placed at beginning each line text within source code languages which use these often impose constraint that line numbers must increase value each subsequent line but may not require that they be consecutive for example basic let x = print x other languages such c ada label identifier usually appearing at beginning line immediately followed by colon for example c success printfthe operation was successful\n algol language allowed both whole numbers identifiers labels both attached by colons following statement but few if any other variants algol allowed whole numbers goto main article goto goto statement combination english words go pronounced accordingly most basic form unconditional transfer control although keyword may either be upper lower case depending on language usually written goto label effect goto statement cause next statement be executed be statement appearing at immediately after indicated label goto statements have been considered harmful by many computer scientists notably dijkstra subroutines main article subroutine terminology for subroutines varies they may alternatively be known routines procedures functions especially if they return results methods especially if they belong classes type classes 1950s computer memories were very small by current standards so subroutines were used primarily reduce program size piece code was written once then used many times from various other places program nowadays subroutines are more frequently used help make program that more structured eg by isolating some particular algorithm hiding some particular data access method if many programmers are working on single program subroutines are one kind modularity that can help split up work sequence main article structured programming structured programming ordered sequencing successive commands considered one basic control structures which used building block for programs alongside iteration recursion choice minimal structured control flow see also structured program theorem may böhm jacopini published article communications acm which showed that any program with gotos could be transformed into goto-free form involving only choice if then else loops while condition do xxx possibly with duplicated code and/or addition boolean variables true/false flags later authors have shown that choice can be replaced by loops yet more boolean variables fact that such minimalism possible does not necessarily mean that desirable after all computers theoretically only need one machine instruction subtract one number from another branch if result negative but practical computers have dozens even hundreds machine instructions what böhm jacopinis article showed was that all programs could be goto-free other research showed that control structures with one entry one exit were much easier understand than any other form primarily because they could be used anywhere statement without disrupting control flow other words they were composable later developments such non-strict programming languages - more recently composable software transactions - have continued this line thought making components programs even more freely composable some academics took purist approach böhm-jacopini result argued that even instructions like break return from middle loops are bad practice they are not needed böhm-jacopini proof thus they advocated that all loops should have single exit point this purist approach embodied pascal programming language designed 1968–1969 which up mid-1990s was preferred tool for teaching introductory programming academia direct application böhm-jacopini theorem may result additional local variables being introduced structured chart may also result some code duplication latter issue called loop half problem this context pascal affected by both these problems according empirical studies cited by eric s roberts student programmers had difficulty formulating correct solutions pascal for several simple problems including writing function for searching element array study by henry shapiro cited by roberts found that using only pascal-provided control structures correct solution was given by only 20% subjects while no subject wrote incorrect code for this problem if allowed write return from middle loop control structures practice most programming languages with control structures have initial keyword which indicates type control structure involved languages then divide whether not control structures have final keyword no final keyword algol c c++ haskell java pascal perl php pl/i python powershell such languages need some way grouping statements together o algol pascal begin end o c c++ java perl php powershell curly brackets { } o pl/1 do end o python uses indentation level see off-side rule o haskell either indentation level curly brackets can be used they can be freely mixed o lua uses do end final keyword ada algol modula-2 fortran mythryl visual basic forms final keyword vary o ada final keyword end + space + initial keyword eg if end if loop end loop o algol mythryl initial keyword spelled backwards eg if fi case esac o fortran final keyword end + initial keyword eg if endif do enddo o modula-2 same final keyword end for everything o visual basic every control structure has its own keyword if end if for next do loop while wend choice if-then-else statements main article conditional programming conditional expressions conditional constructs are features programming language which perform different computations actions depending on whether programmer-specified boolean condition evaluates true false ifgoto form found unstructured languages mimicking typical machine code instruction would jump goto label line number when condition was met ifthenendif rather than being restricted jump any simple statement nested block could follow then key keyword this structured form ifthenelseendif above but with second action be performed if condition false this one most common forms with many variations some require terminal endif others do not c related languages do not require terminal keyword then but do require parentheses around condition conditional statements can be often are nested inside other conditional statements some languages allow else if be combined into elseif avoiding need have series endif other final statements at end compound statement pascal ada c shell script python lisp if > then writelnyes else writelnno if > then putlineyes else putlineno end if if > { printfyes } else { printfno } if then echo yes else echo no fi if > print yes else print no princ if plusp yes no less common variations include some languages such fortran have three-way arithmetic if testing whether numeric value positive negative zero some languages have functional form if statement for instance lisps cond some languages have operator form if statement such cs ternary operator perl supplements c-style if with when unless smalltalk uses iftrue iffalse messages implement conditionals rather than any fundamental language construct less common variations include case switch statements main article switch statement switch statements case statements multiway branches compare given value with specified constants take action according first constant match there usually provision for default action else otherwise be taken if no match succeeds switch statements can allow compiler optimizations such lookup tables dynamic languages cases may not be limited constant expressions might extend pattern matching shell script example on right where implements default case glob matching any string case logic can also be implemented functional form sqls decode statement pascal ada c shell script lisp case somechar a actionona x actiononx yzactiononyandz else actiononnomatch end case somechar when a => actionona when x => actiononx when y | z => actiononyandz when others => actiononnomatch end switch somechar { case a actionona break case x actiononx break case y case z

loops loop sequence statements which specified once but which may be carried out several times succession code inside loop body loop shown below xxx obeyed specified number times once for each collection items until some condition met indefinitely functional programming languages such haskell scheme loops can be expressed by using recursion fixed point iteration rather than explicit looping constructs tail recursion special case recursion which can be easily transformed iteration count-controlled loops main article for loop most programming languages have constructions for repeating loop certain number times note that if n less than these examples then language may specify that body skipped completely that body executed just once with n = most cases counting can go downwards instead upwards step sizes other than can be used for i = n | for i = n do begin xxx | xxx next i | end ------------------------------------------------------------ do i = 1n | for i=1 i current-zipcode displaytallycurrent-zipcode zipcount current-zipcode = new-zipcode zipcount = endif zipcount++ loop collection-controlled loops main article foreach several programming languages eg ada d smalltalk php perl object pascal java c matlab mythryl visual basic ruby python javascript fortran later have special constructs which allow implicitly looping through all elements array all members set collection somecollection do for item collection do begin xxx end foreach item mycollection { xxx } foreach somearray { xxx } foreach $somearray $k => $v { xxx } collection coll for string s coll {} foreach string s mystringcollection { xxx } $somecollection | foreach-object { $ } forall index = firstlaststep scala has for-expressions which generalise collection-controlled loops also support other uses such asynchronous programming haskell has do-expressions comprehensions which together provide similar functionality for-expressions scala general iteration general iteration constructs such cs for statement common lisps do form can be used express any above sorts loops well others—such looping over number collections parallel where more specific looping construct can be used usually preferred over general iteration construct since often makes purpose expression more clear infinite loops main article infinite loop infinite loops are used assure program segment loops forever until exceptional condition arises such error for instance event-driven program such server should loop forever handling events they occur only stopping when process terminated by operator infinite loops can be implemented using other control flow constructs most commonly unstructured programming this jump back up goto while structured programming this indefinite loop while loop set never end either by omitting condition explicitly setting true while true some languages have special constructs for infinite loops typically by omitting condition from indefinite loop examples include ada loop end loop fortran do end do go for { } ruby loop do end often infinite loop unintentionally created by programming error condition-controlled loop wherein loop condition uses variables that never change within loop continuation with next iteration sometimes within body loop there desire skip remainder loop body continue with next iteration loop some languages provide statement such continue most languages skip next perl ruby which will do this effect prematurely terminate innermost loop body then resume normal with next iteration if iteration last one loop effect terminate entire loop early redo current iteration some languages like perl ruby have redo statement that restarts current iteration from beginning restart loop ruby has retry statement that restarts entire loop from initial iteration early exit from loops when using count-controlled loop search through table might be desirable stop searching soon required item found some programming languages provide statement such break most languages exit last perl whose effect terminate current loop immediately transfer control statement immediately following that loop following example done ada which supports both early exit from loops loops with test middle both features are very similar comparing both code snippets will show difference early exit needs be combined with if statement while condition middle self-contained construct with adatext io with adainteger text io procedure printsquares x integer begin readdata loop adainteger text iogetx exit readdata when x = adatext ioput x x adatext ionewline end loop readdata end printsquares python supports conditional execution code depending on whether loop was exited early with break statement not by using else-clause with loop for example for n setofnumbers if isprimen print set contains prime number break else print set did not contain any prime numbers note that else clause above example attached for statement not inner if statement both pythons for while loops support such else clause which executed only if early exit loop has not occurred some languages support breaking out nested loops theory circles these are called multi-level breaks one common usage example searching multi-dimensional table this can be done either via multilevel breaks break out n levels bash php via labeled breaks break out continue at given label java perl alternatives multilevel breaks include single breaks together with state variable which tested break out another level exceptions which are caught at level being broken out placing nested loops function using return effect termination entire nested loop using label goto statement c does not include multilevel break usual alternative use goto implement labeled break python does not have multilevel break continue – this was proposed pep rejected on basis that added complexity was not worth rare legitimate use notion multi-level breaks some interest theoretical computer science because gives rise what nowadays called kosaraju hierarchy s rao kosaraju refined structured program theorem by proving that its possible avoid adding additional variables structured programming long arbitrary-depth multi-level breaks from loops are allowed furthermore kosaraju proved that strict hierarchy programs exists for every integer n there exists program containing multi-level break depth n that cannot be rewritten program with multi-level breaks depth less than n without introducing additional variables one can also return out subroutine executing looped statements breaking out both nested loop subroutine there are other proposed control structures for multiple breaks but these are generally implemented exceptions instead his textbook david watt uses tennents notion sequencer explain similarity between multi-level breaks return statements watt notes that class sequencers known escape sequencers defined sequencer that terminates execution textually enclosing command procedure encompasses both breaks from loops including multi-level breaks return statements commonly implemented however return sequencers may also carry return value whereas break sequencer implemented contemporary languages usually cannot loop variants invariants loop variants loop invariants are used express correctness loops practical terms loop variant integer expression which has initial non-negative value variants value must decrease during each loop iteration but must never become negative during correct execution loop loop variants are used guarantee that loops will terminate loop invariant assertion which must be true before first loop iteration remain true after each iteration this implies that when loop terminates correctly both exit condition loop invariant are satisfied loop invariants are used monitor specific properties loop during successive iterations some programming languages such eiffel contain native support for loop variants invariants other cases support add-on such java modeling languages specification for loop statements java loop sublanguage some lisp dialects are providing extensive sublanguage for describing loops early example can be found conversional lisp interlisp common lisp provides loop macro which implements such sublanguage loop system cross-reference table has been suggested that this article be split into new article titled comparison programming languages control flow discuss may programming language conditional loop early exit continuation redo retry correctness facilities begin middle end count collection

simulated by iterating over incrementing list generator for instance pythons range b c d e deep breaks may be accomplished through use exception handling there no special construct since while function can be used for this there no special construct but users can define general loop functions c++11 standard introduced range-based for stl there stdforeach template function which can iterate on stl containers call unary function for each element functionality also can be constructed macro on these containers count-controlled looping effected by iteration across integer interval early exit by including additional condition for exit eiffel supports reserved word retry however used exception handling not loop control requires java modeling language jml behavioral interface specification language requires loop variants be integers transfinite variants are not supported d supports infinite collections ability iterate over those collections this does not require any special construct deep breaks can be achieved using go procedures common lisp predates concept generic collection type structured non-local control flow many programming languages particularly those which favor more dynamic styles programming offer constructs for non-local control flow these cause flow execution jump out given context resume at some predeclared point conditions exceptions continuations are three common sorts non-local control constructs more exotic ones also exist such generators coroutines async keyword conditions pl/i has some standard conditions eg zerodivide subscriptrange endfile which can be raised which can be intercepted by on condition action programmers can also define use their own named conditions like unstructured if only one statement can be specified so many cases goto needed decide where flow control should resume unfortunately some implementations had substantial overhead both space time especially subscriptrange so many programmers tried avoid using conditions common syntax examples on condition goto label exceptions main article exception handling modern languages have specialized structured construct for exception handling which does not rely on use goto multi-level breaks returns for example c++ one can write try { xxx1 // somewhere here xxx2 // use throw somevalue xxx3 } catch someclass& someid { // catch value someclass actionforsomeclass } catch sometype& anotherid { // catch value sometype actionforsometype } catch { // catch anything not already caught actionforanythingelse } any number variety catch clauses can be used above if there no catch matching particular throw control percolates back through subroutine calls and/or nested blocks until matching catch found until end main program reached at which point program forcibly stopped with suitable error message owing c++s influence catch keyword reserved for declaring pattern-matching exception handler other languages popular today like java c some other languages like ada use keyword exception introduce exception handler then may even employ different keyword when ada for pattern matching few languages like applescript incorporate placeholders exception handler syntax for automatically extracting several pieces information when exception occurs this approach exemplified below by on error construct from applescript try set mynumber mynumber / on error e number n from f t partial result pr if e = cant divide by zero then display dialog you must not do that end try david watts textbook also analyzes exception handling framework sequencers introduced this article section on early exits from loops watt notes that abnormal situation generally exemplified with arithmetic overflows input/output failures like file not found kind error that detected some low-level program unit but handler more naturally located high-level program unit for example program might contain several calls read files but action perform when file not found depends on meaning purpose file question program thus handling routine for this abnormal situation cannot be located low-level system code watts further notes that introducing status flags testing caller single-exit structured programming even multi-exit return sequencers would entail results situation where application code tends get cluttered by tests status flags that programmer might forgetfully lazily omit test status flag fact abnormal situations represented by status flags are by default ignored watt notes that contrast status flags testing exceptions have opposite default behavior causing program terminate unless programmer explicitly deals with exception some way possibly by adding code willfully ignore based on these arguments watt concludes that jump sequencers escape sequencers arent suitable dedicated exception sequencer with semantics discussed above object pascal d java c python finally clause can be added try construct no matter how control leaves try code inside finally clause guaranteed execute this useful when writing code that must relinquish expensive resource such opened file database connection when finished processing filestream stm = null // c example try { stm = new filestream logfiletxt filemodecreate return processstuffstm // may throw exception } finally { if stm = null stmclose } since this pattern fairly common c has special syntax using filestream stm = new filestream logfiletxt filemodecreate { return processstuffstm // may throw exception } upon leaving using-block compiler guarantees that stm object released effectively binding variable file stream while abstracting from side effects initializing releasing file pythons with statement rubys block argument fileopen are used similar effect all languages mentioned above define standard exceptions circumstances under which they are thrown users can throw exceptions their own fact c++ allows users throw catch almost any type including basic types like int whereas other languages like java arent permissive continuations main article continuation async c introduced async keyword for supporting asynchronous i/o direct style generators generators also known semicoroutines allow control be yielded consumer method temporarily typically using yield keyword like async keyword this supports programming direct style coroutines coroutines are functions that can yield control each other - form co-operative multitasking without threads coroutines can be implemented library if programming language provides either continuations generators - so distinction between coroutines

this was actually implemented intercal deliberately esoteric programming language his article structured programming with go statements donald knuth identified two situations which were not covered by control structures listed above gave examples control structures which could handle these situations despite their utility these constructions have not yet found their way into mainstream programming languages loop with test middle following was proposed by dahl loop loop xxx1 readchar while test while not atendoffile xxx2 writechar repeat repeat if xxx1 omitted we get loop with test at top if xxx2 omitted we get loop with test at bottom if while omitted we get infinite loop hence this single construction can replace several constructions most programming languages possible variant allow more than one while test within loop but use exitwhen see next section appears cover this case better languages lacking this construct generally emulate using equivalent infinite-loop-with-break idiom while true { xxx1 if not test break xxx2 } ada above loop construct loop-while-repeat can be represented using standard infinite loop loop - end loop that has exit when clause middle not be confused with exitwhen statement following section with adatextio with adaintegertextio procedure printsquares x integer begin readdata loop adaintegertextiogetx exit readdata when x = adatext ioput x x adatext ionewline end loop readdata end printsquares naming loop like readdata this example optional but permits leaving outer loop several nested loops multiple early exit/exit from nested loops this was proposed by zahn modified version presented here exitwhen eventa eventb eventc xxx exits eventa actiona eventb actionb eventc actionc endexit exitwhen used specify events which may occur within xxx their occurrence indicated by using name event statement when some event does occur relevant action carried out then control passes just after endexit this construction provides very clear separation between determining that some situation applies action be taken for that situation exitwhen conceptually similar exception handling exceptions similar constructs are used for this purpose many languages following simple example involves searching two-dimensional table for particular item exitwhen found missing for i = n do for j = m do if table = target then found missing exits found

combat not primary activity some adventure games will include minigame from another video game genre which are not always appreciated by adventure game purists hybrid action-adventure games blend action adventure games throughout game experience incorporating more physical challenges than pure adventure games at faster pace this definition hard apply however with some debate among designers about which games are action games which involve enough non-physical challenges be considered action-adventures adventure games are also distinct from role-playing video games that involve action team-building points management adventure games lack numeric rules relationships seen role-playing games seldom have internal economy these games lack any skill system combat opponent be defeated through strategy tactics however some hybrid games exist here where role-playing games with strong narrative puzzle elements are considered rpg-adventures finally adventure games are classified separately from puzzle video games although adventure game may involve puzzle-solving they typically involve player-controlled avatar interactive story game design puzzle-solving adventure games contain variety puzzles decoding messages finding using items opening locked doors finding exploring new locations solving puzzle will unlock access new areas game world reveal more game story logic puzzles where mechanical devices are designed with abstract interfaces test players deductive reasoning skills are common some puzzles are criticized for obscurity their solutions for example combination clothes line clamp deflated rubber duck used gather key stuck between subway tracks longest journey which exists outside games narrative serves only obstacle player others have been criticized for requiring players blindly guess either by clicking on right pixel by guessing right verb games that use text interface games that require players navigate mazes have also become less popular although earliest text-adventure games usually required players draw map if they wanted navigate abstract space gathering using items many adventure games make use inventory management screen distinct gameplay mode players are only able pick up some objects game so player usually knows that only objects that can be picked up are important because can be difficult for player know if they missed important item they will often scour every scene for items for games that utilize point click device players will sometimes engage systematic search known pixel hunt games try avoid this by highlighting item by snapping players cursor item many puzzles these games involve gathering using items from their inventory players must apply lateral thinking techniques where they apply real-world extrinsic knowledge about objects unexpected ways for example by putting deflated inner tube on cactus create slingshot which requires player realize that inner tube stretchy they may need carry items their inventory for long duration before they prove useful thus normal for adventure games test players memory where challenge can only be overcome by recalling piece information from earlier game there seldom any time pressure for these puzzles focusing more on players ability reason than on quick-thinking story setting themes adventure games are single-player experiences that are largely story-driven more than any other genre adventure games depend upon their story setting create compelling single-player experience they are typically set immersive environment often fantasy world try vary setting from chapter chapter add novelty interest experience comedy common theme games often script comedic responses when players attempt actions combinations that are ridiculous impossible since adventure games are driven by storytelling character development usually follows literary conventions personal emotional growth rather than new powers abilities that affect gameplay player often embarks upon quest required unravel mystery situation about which little known these types mysterious stories allow designers get around what ernest w adams calls problem amnesia where player controls protagonist but must start game without their knowledge experience story-events typically unfold player completes new challenges puzzles but order make such storytelling less mechanical new elements story may also be triggered by player movement dialogue conversation trees further information dialog tree adventure games have strong storylines with significant dialog sometimes make effective use recorded dialog narration from voice actors this genre game known for representing dialog conversation tree players are able engage non-player character by choosing line pre-written dialog from menu which triggers response from game character these conversations are often designed tree structure with players deciding between each branch dialog pursue however there are always finite number branches pursue some adventure games devolve into selecting each option one-by-one conversing with characters can reveal clues about how solve puzzles including hints about what that character would want before they will cooperate with player other conversations will have far-reaching consequences deciding disclose valuable secret that has been entrusted player characters may also be convinced reveal their own secrets either through conversation by giving them something that will benefit them goals success failure primary goal adventure games completion assigned quest early adventure games often had high scores some zork also assigned player rank text description based on their score high scores provide player with secondary goal serve indicator progression while high scores are now less common external reward systems xbox lives achievements perform similar role primary failure condition adventure games inherited from more action-oriented games player death without clearly identified enemies other genres its inclusion adventure games controversial many developers now either avoid take extra steps foreshadow death some early adventure games trapped players unwinnable situations without ending game infocoms text adventure hitchhikers guide galaxy has been criticized for scenario where failing pick up pile junk mail at beginning game prevented player much later from completing game adventure games developed by lucasarts purposely avoided creating dead-end situation for player due negative reactions such situations subgenres text adventures interactive fiction main article interactive fiction computer terminal running zork one first commercially successful text adventure games text adventures convey games story through passages text revealed player response typed instructions early text adventures colossal cave adventure hugos house horrors scott adams games used simple verb-noun parser interpret these instructions allowing player interact with objects at basic level for example by typing get key later text adventures modern interactive fiction use natural language processing enable more complex player commands like take key from desk notable examples advanced text adventures include most games developed by infocom including zork hitchhikers guide galaxy with onset graphic adventures text adventure fell wayside though medium remains

point-and-click adventure games are those where player typically controls their character through point-and-click interface using computer mouse similar pointing device though additional control schemes may also be available player clicks move their character around interact with non-player characters often initiating conversation trees with them examine objects games settings with their characters item inventory many point-and-click games would include list on-screen verbs describe specific actions manner text adventure but newer games have used more context-sensitive user interface elements reduce eliminate this approach often these games come down collecting items for characters inventory figuring where right time use that item player would need use clues from visual elements

science general since game ai for npcs centered on appearance intelligence good gameplay within environment restrictions its approach very different from that traditional ai workarounds cheats are acceptable many cases computer abilities must be toned down give human players sense fairness this for example true first-person shooter games where npcs otherwise perfect aiming would be beyond human

implemented on discrete logic strictly based on competition two players without ai games that featured single player mode with enemies started appearing 1970s first notable ones for arcade appeared taito game speed race racing video game atari games qwak duck hunting light gun shooter pursuit fighter aircraft dogfighting simulator two text-based computer games from hunt wumpus star trek also had enemies enemy movement was based on stored patterns incorporation microprocessors would allow more computation random elements overlaid into movement patterns light cycle characters compete be last

patterns in-game events dependent on hash functions based on players input galaxian added more complex varied enemy movements including maneuvers by individual enemies who break out formation pac-man introduced ai patterns maze games with added quirk different personalities for each enemy karate champ later introduced ai patterns fighting games although poor ai prompted release second version first queen was tactical action rpg which featured characters that can be controlled by computers ai following leader role-playing video game dragon quest iv introduced tactics system where user can

component early electronic games imposed by crude graphics small view-screens power consumption video games remained primary focus early electronic game market arcade one-off handheld audio games - early years handheld version ataris touch me - one earliest audio games atari released first audio game touch me housed arcade cabinet touch me featured series lights which would flash with

company released handheld audio game entitled simon at studio new york city whereas touch me had been competition with other visual-centric video games consequently remained only minor success allure personal electronic game allowed simon capture much greater share market simon became immediate success eventually becoming pop culture symbol 1980s decades following release simon numerous clones

spanning years tts-enabled video games was first made widely available audio game through macintalk before graphical operating systems like windows most home computers used text-based operating systems such dos being text-based meant that they were relatively accessible visually impaired users requiring only additional use text-to-speech tts software for same reason following development tts software text-based games such early text-only works interactive fiction were also equally accessible users with without visual impairment since availability such software was not commonly accessible until inclusion macintalk program on apple computers library games which became accessible vision impaired spanned everything from earliest text adventure colossal cave adventure comparatively advanced works interactive fiction which had developed subsequent years although popularity this genre has waned general market video-centric games became dominant form electronic game this library still growing with freeware development by devoted enthusiasts new interactive fiction titles each year accessibility for visually impaired began change some time prior advent graphical operating systems computers became powerful enough support more video-centric games this created gap between electronic games for seeing games for blind — gap that has by now grown substantially due strong market bias favor seeing electronic games were primarily developed for this demographic while seeing gamers could venture into gaming worlds such video game titles myst final fantasy doom blind gamers were relegated playing more mundane games such blackjack battleship video games flourished became increasingly common however amateur game designers began adapt video games for blind via sound time audio game programmers began develop audio-only games based smaller smaller degree on existing video game ideas instead focusing on possibilities game immersion feedback with sound specifically 3-dimensional positional audio binaural recording has been developed since now figures prominently for example such audio games bbbeat effect this sound played left center right channel indicate objects position virtual gaming environment generally this involves stereo panning various sound effects many which are looped serve indicators hazards objects with which user can interact volume also plays major role audio games primarily indicate objects proximity with reference user pitch sound often varied convey other information about object symbolizes voice talent used indicate menu items rather than text these parameters have allowed for creation among other genres side scrollers action adventures shooters arcade style games console audio games modern era most audio games are now developed by several small companies consisting only team people main audience remains primarily visually impaired users however game market at large gradually taking more notice audio games well due issue game accessibility commercial interest audio games has steadily grown result artists students have created number experimental freeware pc audio games explore possibilities limitations this gaming form recently audio games have also become very interesting for mobile gaming market since no screen needed warps real sound kaze no regret field console-gaming there has been very little way audio-games one notable exception has been innovative incorporation strong audio elements several games produced by japanese video game company warp warp formerly eim was founded by musician kenji eno consisted five-man team including first-time designer fumito ueda warp developed game called real sound for sega saturn which was later ported dreamcast renamed real sound kaze no regret real sound regrets wind this game featured no visuals at all was entirely dependent upon sound discussing real sounds production eno has stated that i got tired i didnt want people think that they could predict what warp would do next also i had chance visit people who are visually disabled i learned that there are blind people who play action games course theyre not able have full experience theyre kind trying force themselves be able play but theyre making effort so i thought that if you turn off monitor both you are just hearing game so after you finish game you can have equal conversation about with blind person thats inspiration behind this game well so sega was asking for exclusive rights game i said ok if youll donate thousand saturns blind people then ill donate thousand game along with saturns my condition was that if sega would go for this idea i would make that game sega exclusive so thats how this happened its been several years now course contract probably isnt valid anymore but reason that i havent done anything with this game that i made this promise with sega back day its exclusive because those conditions following release real sound warp again made use novel employment audio elements sega saturn game enemy zero where enemies game are invisible can only be detected through auditory clues further emphasis on aural environment derived from games inclusion soundtrack created by minimalist musicologist michael nyman audio-specific elements used gameplay have been recognized warps d series including d d2 which both incorporate soundtracks created by eno warp stopped production video games changed their name superwarp following number problems with video game producers mixed reviews games markedly mediocre sales result warp games have become quite rare have gained cult status they are increasingly sought after superwarps work focussed on network services dvd products online music until when company still under direction kenji eno was renamed from yellow orange

σημαντικός sēmantikos significant primarily linguistic also philosophical study meaning—in language programming languages formal logics semiotics focuses on relationship between signifiers —like words phrases signs symbols—and what they stand for their denotation international scientific vocabulary semantics also called semasiology word semantics was first used by michel bréal french philologist denotes range ideas—from popular highly technical often used ordinary language for denoting problem understanding that comes down word selection connotation this problem understanding has been subject many formal enquiries over long period time especially field formal semantics linguistics study interpretation signs symbols used agents communities within particular circumstances contexts within this view sounds facial expressions body language proxemics have semantic meaningful content each comprises several branches study written language things like paragraph structure punctuation bear semantic content other forms language bear other semantic content formal study semantics intersects with many other fields inquiry including lexicology syntax pragmatics etymology others independently semantics also well-defined field its own right often with synthetic properties philosophy language semantics reference are closely connected further related fields include philology communication semiotics formal study semantics can therefore be manifold complex semantics contrasts with syntax study combinatorics units language without reference their meaning pragmatics study relationships

concern how meaning attaches larger chunks text possibly result composition from smaller units meaning traditionally semantics has included study sense denotative reference truth conditions argument structure thematic roles discourse analysis linkage all these syntax montague grammar late 1960s richard montague proposed system for defining semantic entries lexicon terms lambda calculus these terms syntactic parse sentence john ate every bagel would consist subject john predicate ate every bagel montague demonstrated that meaning sentence altogether could be decomposed into meanings its parts relatively few rules combination logical predicate thus obtained would be elaborated further eg using truth theory models which ultimately relate meanings set tarskiian universals which may lie outside logic notion such meaning atoms primitives basic language thought hypothesis from 1970s despite its elegance montague grammar was limited by context-dependent variability word sense led several attempts at incorporating context such situation semantics 1980s truth-values are incomplete they get assigned based on context generative lexicon 1990s categories types are incomplete get assigned based on context dynamic turn semantics linguistics theoretical cognitive constraint-based generative structuralist quantitative functional theories grammar phonology morphology

there was no mechanism for learning semantic relations nativist view considered all semantic notions inborn thus even novel concepts were proposed have been dormant some sense this view was also thought unable address many issues such metaphor associative meanings semantic change where meanings within linguistic community change over time qualia subjective experience another issue not addressed by nativist model was how perceptual cues are combined thought eg mental rotation this view semantics innate finite meaning inherent lexical unit that can be composed generate meanings for larger chunks discourse now being fiercely debated emerging domain cognitive linguistics also non-fodorian camp philosophy language challenge motivated by factors internal language such problem resolving indexical anaphora eg this x him last week these situations context serves input but interpreted utterance also modifies context so also output thus interpretation necessarily dynamic meaning sentences viewed contexts changing potentials instead propositions factors external language ie language not set labels stuck on things but toolbox importance whose elements lie way they function rather than their attachments things this view reflects position later wittgenstein his famous game example related positions quine davidson others concrete example latter phenomenon semantic underspecification – meanings are not complete without some elements context take example one word red its meaning phrase such red book similar many other usages can be viewed compositional however colours implied phrases such red wine very dark red hair coppery red soil red skin are very different indeed these colours by themselves would not be called red by native speakers these instances are contrastive so red wine so called only comparison with other kind wine which also not white for same reasons this view goes back de saussure each set synonyms like redouter to dread craindre to fear avoir peur to be afraid has its particular value only because they stand contrast with one another no word has value that can be identified independently what else its vicinity may go back earlier indian views on language especially nyaya view words indicators not carriers meaning attempt defend system based on propositional meaning for semantic underspecification can be found generative lexicon model james pustejovsky who extends contextual operations based on type shifting into lexicon thus meanings are generated on fly you go based on finite context prototype theory another set concepts related fuzziness semantics based on prototypes work eleanor rosch 1970s led view that natural categories are not characterizable terms necessary sufficient conditions but are graded fuzzy at their boundaries inconsistent status their constituent members one may compare with jungs archetype though concept archetype sticks static concept some post-structuralists are against fixed static meaning words derrida following nietzsche talked about slippages fixed meanings systems categories are not objectively out there world but are rooted peoples experience these categories evolve learned concepts world – meaning not objective truth but subjective construct learned from experience language arises out grounding our conceptual systems shared embodiment bodily experience corollary this that conceptual categories ie lexicon will not be identical for different cultures indeed for every individual same culture this leads another debate see sapir–whorf hypothesis eskimo words for snow theories semantics model theoretic semantics main article formal semantics linguistics originates from montagues work see above highly formalized theory natural language semantics which expressions are assigned denotations meanings such individuals truth values functions from one these another truth sentence more interestingly its logical relation other sentences then evaluated relative model formal truth-conditional semantics main article truth-conditional semantics pioneered by philosopher donald davidson another formalized theory which aims associate each natural language sentence with meta-language description conditions under which true for example snow white true if only if snow white challenge arrive at truth conditions for any sentences from fixed meanings assigned individual words fixed rules for how combine them practice truth-conditional semantics similar model-theoretic semantics conceptually however they differ that truth-conditional semantics seeks connect language with statements about real world form meta-language statements rather than with abstract models lexical conceptual semantics main article conceptual semantics this theory effort explain properties argument structure assumption behind this theory that syntactic properties phrases reflect meanings words that head them with this theory linguists can better deal with fact that subtle differences word meaning correlate with other differences syntactic structure that word appears way this gone about by looking at internal structure words these small parts that make up internal structure words are termed semantic primitives lexical semantics main article lexical semantics linguistic theory that investigates word meaning this theory understands that meaning word fully reflected by its context here meaning word constituted by its contextual relations therefore distinction between degrees participation well modes participation are made order accomplish this distinction any part sentence that bears meaning combines with meanings other constituents labeled semantic constituent semantic constituents that cannot be broken down into more elementary constituents are labeled minimal semantic constituents computational semantics main article computational semantics computational semantics focused on processing linguistic meaning order do this concrete algorithms

representing one country members meet annually at general assembly discuss isos strategic objectives organization coordinated by central secretariat based geneva council with rotating membership member bodies provides guidance governance including setting central secretariats annual budget technical management board responsible for over technical committees who develop iso standards iec joint committees iso has formed joint committees with international electrotechnical commission iec develop standards terminology areas electrical electronic related technologies iso/iec jtc information technology main article iso/iec jtc iso/iec joint technical committee jtc was created evelop maintain promote facilitate standards iso/iec jtc joint project committee – energy efficiency renewable energy sources – common terminology iso/iec joint technical committee jtc was created for purpose tandardization field energy efficiency renewable energy sources membership iso member countries with national standards body iso voting rights correspondent members countries without national standards body subscriber members countries with small economies non-member countries with iso 3166-1 codes iso has national members iso has three membership categories member bodies are national bodies considered most representative standards body each country these are only members iso that have voting rights correspondent members are countries that do not have their own standards organization these members are informed about isos work but do not participate standards promulgation subscriber members are countries with small economies they pay reduced membership fees but can follow development standards participating members are called p members opposed observing members who are called o members financing iso funded by combination organizations that manage specific projects loan experts participate technical work subscriptions from member bodies these subscriptions are proportion each countrys gross national product trade figures sale standards international standards other publications see also list international organization for standardization standards isos main products are

unpublished standard may under some circumstances be left off title published work technical reports these are issued when technical committee subcommittee has collected data different kind from that normally published international standard such references explanations naming conventions for these are same for standards except tr prepended instead reports name for example iso/iec tr code practice

specification are named manner similar organizations technical reports for example iso/ts 16952-12006 technical product documentation — reference designation system — part general application rules iso/pas road vehicles — roof load carriers technical corrigenda iso also sometimes issues technical corrigenda where corrigenda plural corrigendum these are amendments made existing standards due minor technical flaws usability improvements limited-applicability extensions they are generally issued with expectation that affected standard will be updated withdrawn at its next scheduled review iso guides these are meta-standards covering matters related international standardization they are named using format iso guide nyyyy title for example iso/iec guide standardization related

model vm previously also called simulation test model when sufficient confidence stability standard under development reached working draft wd produced this form standard but kept internal working group for revision when working draft sufficiently solid working group satisfied that has developed best technical solution problem being addressed becomes committee draft cd if required then sent p-members tc/sc national bodies for ballot cd becomes final committee draft fcd if number positive votes above quorum successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus reached on technical content when reached text finalized for submission draft international standard dis text then submitted national bodies for voting comment within period five months approved for submission final draft international standard fdis if two-thirds majority p-members tc/sc are favour not more than one-quarter total number votes cast are negative iso will then hold ballot with national bodies where no technical changes are allowed yes/no ballot within period two months approved international standard if two-thirds majority p-members tc/sc favour not more than one-quarter total number votes cast are negative after approval only minor editorial changes are introduced into final text final text sent iso central secretariat which publishes international standard products named after iso fact that many iso-created standards are ubiquitous has led on occasion common use iso describe actual product that conforms standard some examples this are many cd images end file extension iso signify that

iso/iec martin bryan outgoing convenor iso/iec jtc1/sc34 wg1 quoted saying i would recommend my successor that perhaps time pass wg1’s outstanding standards over oasis where they can get approval less than year then do pas submission iso which will get lot more attention be approved much faster than standards currently can be within wg1 disparity rules for pas fast-track iso committee generated standards fast making iso laughing stock circles days open standards development are fast disappearing instead we are getting standardization by corporation computer security entrepreneur ubuntu investor mark shuttleworth commented on standardization office open xml process by saying i think de-values confidence people have standards setting process shuttleworth alleged that iso did not carry out its responsibility he also noted that microsoft had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated iso stacked technical committees with microsoft employees solution providers resellers sympathetic office open xml when you have process built on trust when that trust abused iso should halt process iso engineering old boys club these things are boring so you have have lot passion … then suddenly you have investment lot money lobbying you get artificial results process not set up deal with intensive corporate lobbying so you end up with something being standard

character-based line-based that single horizontal series pixels across page referring configuration print head 1970s & 80s dot matrix printers were one more common types printers used for general use such for home small office use such printers normally had either pins on print head early pin printers also existed which did not print descenders there was period during early home computer era when range printers were manufactured under many brands such commodore vic-1525 using seikosha uni-hammer system this used single solenoid with oblique striker that would be actuated times for each column vertical pixels while head was moving at constant speed angle striker would align dots vertically even though head had moved one dot spacing time vertical dot position was controlled by synchronised longitudinally ribbed platen behind paper that rotated rapidly with rib moving vertically seven dot spacings time took print one pixel column 24-pin print heads were able print at higher quality started offer additional type styles were marketed near letter quality by some vendors once price inkjet printers dropped point where they were competitive with dot matrix printers dot matrix printers began fall out favour for general use some dot matrix printers such nec p6300 can be upgraded print colour this achieved through use four-colour ribbon mounted on mechanism provided upgrade kit that replaces standard black ribbon mechanism after installation that raises lowers ribbons needed colour graphics are generally printed four passes at standard resolution thus slowing down printing considerably result colour graphics can take up four times longer print than standard monochrome graphics up 8-16 times long at high resolution mode dot matrix printers are still commonly used low-cost low-quality applications such cash registers demanding very high volume applications like invoice printing impact printing unlike laser printing allows pressure print head be applied stack

typically feature special moves that are triggered using rapid sequences carefully timed button presses joystick movements games traditionally show fighters from side-view even genre has progressed from two-dimensional three-dimensional graphics street fighter ii though not first fighting game popularized standardized conventions genre similar games released prior street fighter ii have since been more explicitly classified fighting games fighting games typically involve hand-to-hand combat but may also feature melee weapons this genre distinct from beat em ups another action genre involving combat where player character must fight many weaker enemies at same time during 1980s publications used terms fighting game beat em up interchangeably along with other terms such martial arts simulation more specific terms such judo simulator with hindsight critics have argued that two types game gradually became dichotomous they evolved though two terms may still be conflated fighting games are sometimes grouped with games that feature boxing ufc wrestling serious boxing games belong more sports game genre than action game genre they aim for more realistic model boxing techniques whereas moves fighting games tend be highly exaggerated models asian martial arts techniques such boxing games mixed martial arts games wrestling games are often described distinct genres without comparison fighting games belong more into sports game genre game design although street fighter ii was not first fighting game popularized established gameplay conventions genre fighting games involve combat between pairs fighters using highly exaggerated martial arts moves they typically revolve around primarily brawling combat sport though some variations feature weaponry games usually display on-screen fighters from side view even fighting games play largely within plane motion games usually confine characters moving left right jumping although some games such fatal fury king fighters allow players move between parallel planes movement recent games tend be rendered three dimensions allow side-stepping but otherwise play like those rendered two dimensions aside from moving around restricted space fighting games limit players actions different offensive defensive maneuvers players must learn which attacks defenses are effective against each other often by trial error blocking basic technique that allows player defend against attacks some games feature more advanced blocking techniques for example capcoms street fighter iii features move termed parrying which causes attacker become momentarily incapacitated similar state termed just defended snks garou mark wolves addition blows such punches kicks players can utilize throwing grappling circumvent blocks predicting opponents moves counter-attacking known countering common element gameplay fighting games also emphasize difference between height blows ranging from low jumping attacks thus strategy becomes important players attempt predict each others moves similar rock–paper–scissors special attacks integral feature fighting games includes use special attacks also called secret moves that employ complex combinations button presses perform particular move beyond basic punching kicking combos which several attacks are chained together using basic punches kicks are another common feature fighting games have been fundamental genre since release street fighter ii some fighting games display combo meter that displays players progress through combo effectiveness such moves often relate difficulty execution degree risk these moves are often beyond ability casual gamer require player have both strong memory excellent timing taunting another feature some fighting games was originally introduced by japanese company snk their game art fighting used add humor games but can also have effect on gameplay such improving strength other attacks sometimes character can even be noted especially for taunting for example dan hibiki from street fighter alpha players objective fighting game win match by depleting their rivals health mortal kombat even allows victor perform gruesome finishing maneuver called fatality matches rounds fighting game matches generally consist several rounds typically best three player who wins most rounds wins match fighting games widely feature life bars which are depleted characters sustain blows each successful attack will deplete characters health game continues until fighters energy reaches zero hence main goal completely deplete life bar ones opponent thus achieving knockout beginning with midways mortal kombat released mortal kombat series introduced fatalities which victor kills knocked-out opponent gruesome manner games such virtua fighter also allow character be defeated by forcing them outside fighting arena awarding ring-out victor round decisions can also be determined by time over if timer present which judges players based on remaining vitality declare winner fighting games often include single player campaign tournament where player must defeat sequence several computer-controlled opponents winning tournament often reveals special story–ending cutscene some games also grant access hidden characters special features upon victory character selection most fighting games players may select from variety characters who have unique fighting styles special moves this became strong convention for genre with release street fighter ii these character choices have led deeper game strategy replay value although fighting games offer female characters their image tends be hypersexualized they have even been featured pin-up girls game magazines male characters fighting games tend have extra-broad chests shoulders huge muscles prominent jaws custom creation create–a–fighter feature some fighting games which allows player customize appearance move set their own character super fire pro wrestling x premium was first game include such feature later fighting games such fighter maker soulcalibur iii mortal kombat armageddon dragon ball z budokai tenkaichi adopted concept multiplayer modes fighting games may also offer multiplayer mode which players fight each other sometimes by letting second player challenge first at any moment during single player match few titles allow up four players compete simultaneously several games have also featured modes that involve teams characters players form tag teams fight matches which combat one-on-one but character may leave arena be replaced by team mate some fighting games have also offered challenge fighting against multiple opponents succession testing players endurance newer titles take advantage online gaming services although lag created by slow data transmission can disrupt split-second timing involved fighting games impact lag some fighting games has been reduced by using technology such ggpo which keeps players games sync by quickly rolling back most recent accurate game state correcting errors then jumping back current frame games using this technology include skullgirls street fighter iii 3rd strike online edition history late 1970s 1980s fighting games find their origin boxing games but evolved towards battles between characters with fantastic abilities complex special maneuvers segas black white boxing game

fury few months before street fighter ii was designed by takashi nishiyama creator original street fighter which was envisioned spiritual successor fatal fury placed more emphasis on storytelling timing special moves added two-plane system where characters could step into foreground background meanwhile sega experimented with dark edge early attempt at fighting game where characters could move all directions sega however never released game outside japan because felt that unrestrained fighting games were unenjoyable sega also attempted introduced 3-d holographic technology genre with

examples game design theory main article game studies game studies gaming theory discipline that deals with critical study games game design players their role society culture prior late-twentieth century academic study games was rare limited fields such history anthropology video game revolution took off early 1980s so did academic interest games resulting field that draws on diverse methodologies schools thought these influences may be characterized broadly three ways social science approach humanities approach industry engineering approach broadly speaking social scientific approach has concerned itself with question what do games do people using tools methods such surveys controlled laboratory experiments ethnography researchers have investigated both positive negative impacts that playing games could have on people more sociologically informed research has sought move away from simplistic ideas gaming either negative positive but rather seeking understand its role location complexities everyday life general terms humanities approach has concerned itself with question what meanings are made through games using tools methods such interviews ethnographies participant observation researchers have investigated various roles that videogames play peoples lives activities together with meaning they assign their experiences from industry perspective lot game studies research can be seen academic response videogame industrys questions regarding products creates sells main question this approach deals with can be summarized how can we create better games with accompanying what makes game good good can be taken mean many different things including providing entertaining engaging experience being easy learn play being innovative having novel experiences different approaches studying this problem have included looking at describing how design games extracting guidelines rules thumb for making better games strategic decision making main article game theory game theory study strategic decision making specifically study mathematical models conflict cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers alternative term suggested more descriptive name for discipline interactive decision theory subject first addressed zero-sum games such that one persons gains exactly equal net losses other participant participants today however game theory applies wide range behavioral relations has developed into umbrella term for logical side decision science games studied game theory are well-defined mathematical objects be fully defined game must specify following elements players game information actions available each player at each decision point payoffs for each outcome rasmusen refers these four essential elements by acronym papi game theorist typically uses these elements along with solution concept their choosing deduce set equilibrium strategies for each player such that when these strategies are employed no player can profit by unilaterally deviating from their strategy these equilibrium strategies determine equilibrium game—a stable state which either one outcome occurs set outcomes occur with known probability design elements games can be characterized by what player does this often referred gameplay major key elements identified this context are tools rules that define overall context game tools play games are often classified by components required play them eg miniatures ball cards board pieces computer places where use leather well established ball has been popular game piece throughout recorded history resulting worldwide popularity ball games such rugby basketball football cricket tennis volleyball other tools are more idiosyncratic certain region many countries europe for instance have unique standard decks playing cards other games such chess may be traced primarily through development evolution its game pieces many game tools are tokens meant represent other things token may be pawn on board play money intangible item such point scored games such hide-and-seek tag do not utilise any obvious tool rather their interactivity defined by environment games with same similar rules may have different gameplay if environment altered for example hide-and-seek school building differs from same game park auto race can be radically different depending on track street course even with same cars rule development see also game mechanics gameplay balance game design whereas games are often characterized by their tools they are often defined by their rules while rules are subject variations changes enough change rules usually results new game there are exceptions this that some games deliberately involve changing their own rules but even then there are often immutable meta-rules rules generally determine turn order rights responsibilities players each players goals player rights may include when they may spend resources move tokens victory conditions common win conditions are being first amass certain quota points tokens settlers catan having greatest number tokens at end game monopoly some relationship ones game tokens those ones opponent chesss checkmate single multiplayer most games require multiple players however single-player games are unique respect type challenges player faces many games described single-player may be termed actually puzzles recreations unlike game with multiple players competing with against each other reach games goal one-player game battle solely against element environment artificial opponent against ones own skills against time against chance storyline plot stories told games may focus on narrative elements that can be communicated through use mechanics player choice narrative plots games generally have clearly defined simplistic structure mechanical choices on part designers often drastically effect narrative elements game however due lack unified standardized teaching understanding narrative elements games individual interpretations methods terminology vary wildly because this most narrative elements games are created unconsciously intuitively however general rule game narratives increase complexity scale player choice game mechanics increase complexity scale one example this removing players ability directly affect plot for limited time this lack player choice necessitates increase mechanical complexity could be used metaphor symbolize depression that felt by character narrative luck strategy games tools rules will result its requiring skill strategy luck combination thereof are classified accordingly games skill include games physical skill such wrestling tug war hopscotch target shooting stake games mental skill such checkers chess games strategy include checkers chess go arimaa tic-tac-toe often require special equipment play them games chance include gambling games blackjack mah-jongg roulette etc well snakes ladders rock paper scissors most require equipment such cards dice most games contain two all three these elements for example american football baseball involve both physical skill strategy while tiddlywinks poker monopoly combine strategy chance many card board games combine all three most trick-taking games involve mental skill strategy element chance do many strategic board games such risk settlers catan carcassonne use educational tool further information learning through play by learning through play children can develop social cognitive skills mature emotionally gain self-confidence required engage new experiences environments key ways that young children learn include playing being with other people being active exploring new experiences talking themselves communication with others meeting physical mental challenges being shown how do new things practicing repeating skills having fun play develops childrens content knowledge provides children opportunity develop social skills competences disposition learn play-based learning based on vygotskian model scaffolding where teacher pays attention on specific elements play activity provides encouragement feedback on childrens learning when children engage real-life imaginary

charles darrows patent for monopoly includes specific design elements developed during prototype phase prototypes are very common later stages board game design prototype circles many cities today provide opportunity for designers play critique each others games board game design development rules presentational aspects board game when player takes part game players self-subjection rules that creates sense purpose for duration game maintaining players interest throughout gameplay experience goal board game design achieve this board game designers emphasize different aspects such social interaction strategy competition target players differing needs by providing for short versus long-play luck versus skill beyond this board game design reflects culture which board game produced most ancient board games known today are over years old they are frequently abstract character their design primarily focused on core set simple rules those that are still played today games like go c400bc mancala c700ad chess c600ad have gone through many presentational and/or rule variations case chess for example new variants are developed constantly focus on certain aspects game just for variations sake traditional board games date from nineteenth early twentieth century whereas ancient board game design was primarily focused on rules alone traditional board games were often influenced by victorian mores academic eg history geography moral didacticism were important design features for traditional games puritan associations between dice devil meant that early american game designers

classified independent their setting game-world content unlike other works fiction such films books for example shooter game still shooter game regardless whether takes place fantasy world outer space with nearly all varieties genre classification matter any individual video games specific genre open personal interpretation moreover each individual game may belong several genres at once contents history definition practice studies see also references history first attempt classify different genres video games was made by chris crawford his book art computer game design this book crawford primarily focused on players experience activities required for gameplay here he also stated that state computer game design changing quickly we would therefore expect taxonomy presented become obsolete inadequate short time since then among other genres platformer shooter genres which hardly existed at time have gained lot popularity though genres were mostly just interesting for game studies 1980s more money was made video game industry 1990s both smaller independent publishers had little chance surviving because this games settled more into set genres that larger publishers retailers could use for marketing definition this space-themed video game shoot em up side-scrolling shooter due direct active participation player video game genres differ from literary film genres though one could state that space invaders science-fiction video game such classification ignores differences similarities which are be found players experience game contrast visual aesthetics games which can vary greatly argued that interactivity characteristics that are common all games focusing on these characteristics would allow more nuanced meaningful critical vocabulary for discussing video games regardless there little agreement on how game genres are created classified resulting multiple classification schemes descriptive names genres take into account goals game protagonist even perspective offered player for example first-person shooter game that played from first-person perspective involves practice shooting term subgenre may be used refer category within genre further specify genre game under discussion whereas shooter game genre name first-person shooter third-person shooter are common subgenres shooter genre other examples such prefixes are real-time turn based top-down side-scrolling video games may have aspects that dont fall within genre game classified however aberrations are tolerated some degree for example one weapons shooter game might be something other than gun which may be seen breach games rules if shooter game only featured weapons that arent guns would no longer be accepted representative its genre game might fail commercially because its misleading label target audience underlying theme purpose game are sometimes used genre identifier such with games for girls christian game serious game respectively however because these terms do not indicate anything about gameplay video game these are not considered genres practice video game genres vary specificity with popular video game reviews using genre names varying from action baseball this practice basic themes more fundamental characteristics are used alongside each other game may combine aspects multiple genres such way that becomes hard classify under existing genres for example because grand theft auto iii combined shooting driving roleplaying unusual way was hard classify using existing terms since then term grand theft auto clone has been used describe games mechanically similar grand theft auto iii similarly term roguelike has been developed for games that share similarities with rogue elements role-playing genre which focuses on storytelling character improvements have been implemented many different genres video games this because addition story action strategy puzzle video games does not take away from core gameplay but adds incentive other than survival experience studies studying video game genres discipline has only been done some extent historical genre video game genres developed naturally are therefore uncategorized according lars konzack university copenhagen one should not expect that may fully describe field video game genres though hat not say that no formal approach unwelcome discouraged furthermore konzack states that with every new video game video game genres slowly radically transform with most games having small changes but once while new game comes along radically change how specific genre perceived richard van eck argues that there are multiple ways for categorizing video game genres use one them being popular genre system used by game publishers mainstream gaming press these are used by players well interpret characteristics individual games another way defining genres are proposed by designers who have extended revised popular genre system lastly van eck claims that academics various disciplines have approached topic their own way attempted create categorization video games though all these approaches share objective making meaningful distinctions they differ somewhat purpose where publishers marketers use genres buzzword attract sales academics might attempt understand how issue genre fits into digital games extended from tradition print-based writing film other forms cultural production

2000s were available through variety platforms throughout asia europe north america ultimately most territories where modern carrier networks handsets were available by mid-2000s however mobile games distributed by mobile operators third party portals channels initially developed monetise downloadable ringtones wallpapers other small pieces content using premium sms direct carrier charges billing

available even bottom-of-the-range devices colour screens multi-channel sound most importantly ability download store new applications implemented cross-industry standards such j2me brew paved way for commercial mobile game publishing some early companies utilized camera phone technology for mobile games such namco panasonic namco released fighting game that used cell phones camera create character

games became particularly popular on mobile phones which were ideal platform for arcade-style games designed for shorter play sessions present day japan worlds largest market by revenue for mobile games japanese gaming market today becoming increasingly dominated by mobile games which generated $51 billion more than traditional console games country nokia tried create its own dedicated mobile gaming platform with n-gage but this effort failed due mixture unpopular design decisions poor software support competition from widely regarded more technically advanced handheld consoles n-gage brand was retained for few years games service included on nokias general-purpose phones europe downloadable mobile games were introduced by “les games” portal from orange france run by in-fusio whereas before mobile games were usually commissioned directly by handset manufacturers now also mobile operators started act distributors games operators were not keen on handling potentially hundreds relationships with one- two-person developers mobile aggregators publishers started act middleman between operators developers that further reduced revenue share seen by developers launch apples app store radically changed market first all widened consumers opportunities choose where download apps application store on device operator’s store third party stores via open internet such getjar handango apple users however can only use apple app store since apple forbids distribution apps via any other distribution channel secondly mobile developers can upload applications directly app store without typically lengthy negotiations with publishers operators which increased their revenue share made mobile game development more profitable thirdly tight integration app store with device itself led many consumers try out apps games market received considerable boost consequently number commercially highly successful mobile games proliferated soon after launch app store early app store successes such angry birds rolando flight control doodle jump were highly publicised successes that introduced many millions new players mobile games encouraged early gold rush developers publishers enter market calculator games clone tetris being played on ti-83 plus fan-made game similar game portal calculator gaming form gaming which games are played on programmable calculators especially graphing calculators early example type-in program darth vaders force battle for ti-59 published byte october magazine also published version hunt wumpus for hp-41c few other games exist for earliest programmable calculators including hewlett-packard 9100a one first scientific calculators including long-popular lunar lander game often used early programming exercise however limited program address space lack easy program storage made calculator gaming rarity even programmables became cheap relatively easy obtain wasnt until early 1990s when graphing calculators became more powerful cheap enough be common among high school students for use mathematics new graphing calculators with their ability transfer files one another from computer for backup could double game consoles calculators such hp-48 ti-82 could be programmed proprietary programming languages such rpl programming language ti-basic directly on calculator programs could also be written assembly language less often c on desktop computer transferred calculator calculators became more powerful memory sizes increased games increased complexity by 1990s programmable calculators were able run implementations by hobbyists games such lemmings doom lemmings for hp-48 was released doom for hp-48 was created some games such dope wars caused controversy when students played them school look feel these games on hp-48 class calculator due lack dedicated audio video circuitry providing hardware acceleration can at most be compared one offered by 8-bit handheld consoles such early game boy gameking low resolution monochrome grayscale graphics built-in games non-java brew enabled cell phones games continue be programmed on graphing calculators with increasing complexity new wave games has appeared after release ti-83 plus/ti-84 plus series among tis first graphing calculators natively support assembly ti-basic programming also rose popularity after release third-party libraries assembly remained language choice for these calculators which run on zilog z80 processor although some assembly implements have been created ease difficulty learning assembly language for those running on motorola processor like ti-89 c programming possible using tigcc has begun displace assembly because they are easy program without outside tools calculator games have survived despite proliferation mobile devices such mobile phones pdas industry structure total global revenue from mobile games was estimated at $26 billion by informa telecoms media total revenue was $58 billion largest mobile gaming markets were asia-pacific nations japan china followed by united states market had already reached $78 billion new report was released november showing that app developers would

today largely defunct palm os symbian adobe flash lite ntt docomos doja suns java me qualcomms brew wipi blackberry nook early incarnations windows mobile today most widely supported platforms are apples ios googles android mobile version microsofts windows formerly windows phone also actively supported although terms market share remains marginal compared ios android java was at one time most common platform for mobile games however its performance limits lead adoption various native binary formats for more sophisticated games due its ease porting between mobile operating systems extensive

hardware ios-native games mobile game displaying full-screen interstitial ad for different game typically commercial mobile games use one following monetisation models pay-per-download subscription free-to-play freemium advertising-supported until recently main option for generating revenues was simple payment on downloading game subscription business models also existed had proven popular some markets notably japan but were rare europe today number new business models have emerged which are often collectively referred “freemium” game download itself typically free then revenue generated after download either through in-app transactions advertisements this resulted $34 billion spent on mobile games common limits mobile games mobile games tend be small scope relation mainstream pc console games many prioritise innovative design ease play over visual spectacle storage memory limitations sometimes dictated at platform level place constraints on file size that presently rule out direct migration many modern pc console games mobile one major problem for developers publishers mobile games describing game such detail that gives customer enough information make purchasing decision location-based mobile games games played on mobile device using localization technology like gps are called location-based games location-based mobile games these are not only played on mobile hardware but also integrate players position into game concept other words while does not matter for normal mobile game where exactly you are play them anywhere at any time players coordinate movement are main elements location-based mobile game well known example treasure hunt game geocaching which can be played on any mobile device with integrated external gps receiver external gps receivers are usually connected via bluetooth more more mobile phones with integrated gps are expected come besides geocaching there exist several other location-based mobile games such botfighters which are rather stage research prototypes than commercial success multipurpose games since mobile devices have become present majority households at least developed countries there are more more games created with educational lifestyle- health-improvement purposes for example mobile games can be used speech-language pathology example — outloud apps childrens rehabilitation hospitals finnish startup rehaboo acquiring new useful healthy habits habitica app memorising things learning languages memrise there are also apps with similar purposes which are not games per se this case they are called gamified apps sometimes difficult draw line between multipurpose games gamified apps multiplayer mobile games many mobile games support multiple players either remotely over network locally via wifi bluetooth similar technology there are several options for playing multiplayer games on mobile phones live synchronous tournaments turn-based asynchronous tournaments live tournaments random players from around world are matched together compete this done using different networks including game center google+ mobango nextpeer facebook asynchronous tournaments there are two methods used by game developers centered around idea that players matches are recorded then broadcast at later time other players same tournament asynchronous gameplay resolves issue needing players have continuous live connection this gameplay different since players take individual turns game therefore allowing players continue playing against human opponents this done using different networks including openfeint now defunct facebook some companies use regular turn based system where end results are posted so all players can see who won tournament other companies take screen recordings live players broadcast them other players at later point time allow players feel that they are always interacting with another human opponent infrared older mobile phones supporting mobile gaming have infrared connectivity for data sharing with other phones pcs bluetooth some mobile games are connected through bluetooth using special hardware games are designed communicate with each other through this protocol share game information basic restriction that both users have be within limited distance get connected bluetooth device can accept up connections from other devices using client/server architecture 3g 3g allows most cases realtime multiplayer gaming based on technologies faster than gprs lte wi-fi lte allows very fast data rates combined with low stalls based on technologies faster than 3g wi-fi often used for connecting at home distribution mobile games can be distributed one four ways over air ota - game binary file delivered mobile device via wireless carrier networks sideloaded - game binary file loaded onto phone while connected pc either via usb cable bluetooth pre-installed - game binary file preloaded onto device by original equipment manufacturer oem mobile

gaming world named ewb 25th its best games all time second highest ranking for any sports game that 1981–1996 period after fps football 1990s 1990s began bit era wave fourth generation video game consoles were created handle more complex games graphics electronic arts producer richard hilleman hired gamestars scott orr re-design john madden football for fast-growing sega genesis orr hilleman released game that still recognized today madden football best-selling sports game north america up until that time they focused on producing head-to-head two-player game with intuitive interface responsive controls also taito released football champ early soccer football game allow up four players multiplayer mode involving both competitive cooperative gameplay also let players perform number actions including back heel power kick high kick sliding tackle super shot fouling other players kicking punching pulling shirts which player can get away with if referee isnt looking but referee will hand out yellow red penalty card if he spots foul play american football game tecmo super bowl was first mainstream sports game feature both league player association licenses sport emulated previous titles either had one license other but tecmo super bowl was first feature real nfl players on real teams orr joined ea full-time after success madden on sega genesis began ten-year period his career where he personally supervised production madden football series during this time ea formed ea sports brand name used for sports games they produced ea sports created several ongoing series with new version released each year reflect changes sport its teams since previous release eventually 1990s graphics were introduced sports arcade games particular segas virtua striker was first association football game use computer graphics was also notable for its early use texture mapping that same year saw arrival 32-bit era video game consoles with release sega saturn sonys playstation both capable graphics soon after graphics cards were introduced for personal computers pcs these updated systems allowed home sports games also be made first sports console game exploit these updates was gremlin interactives actua soccer released for playstation meanwhile sierra online released front page sports football for pc following year computer gaming world named twelfth best games all time highest

namcos alpine surfer arcades uep systems game cool boarders for playstation console following year squares popular role-playing video game final fantasy vii included snowboarding minigame that was later released independent snowboarding game final fantasy vii snowboarding for mobile phones ssx was released based around boardercross game featured fast downhill races avoiding various objects whilst using others perform jumps increase players speed sega released one first mainstream skateboarding games top skater arcades where introduced skateboard controller interface following year saw release console skateboarding game street sk8er developed by atelier double published by electronic arts subgenre was further popularized by tony hawks pro skater arcade-like skateboarding game where players were challenged execute elaborate tricks collect series elements hidden throughout level sports games became big business on december electronic arts began string deals that granted exclusive rights several prominent sports organizations starting with nfl this was quickly followed with two deals january securing rights afl espn licenses this was particularly hard blow sega previous holder espn license who had already been affected by eas nfl deal market for football brands was being quickly taken by ea take-two interactive responded by contacting major league baseball players association signing deal that granted exclusive third-party major-league baseball rights deal not restrictive first-party projects were still allowed nba was then approached by several developers but declined enter into exclusivity agreement instead granting long-term licenses electronic arts take-two interactive midway games sony atari april ea furthered its hold on american football licensing by securing rights all ncaa brands motion detection sega activator ir motion detection main article sega genesis § peripherals sega released sega activator motion detection game controller designed respond players body movements for their genesis console activator was based on light harp midi controller invented by assaf gurner like light harp activator octagonal frame that lies on floor light-emitting diodes leds on frame vertically project thin invisible beams infrared light when something such players arm leg ineerrupts beam device reads distance at which interruption occurred interprets signal command device can also interpret signals from multiple beams simultaneously ie chords distinct command sega designed especial activator motions for few their own game releases by tailoring motion signals specifically for game sega attempted provide more intuitive gaming experience player could for example compete greatest heavyweights ring eternal champions by miming punches despite these efforts activator was commercial failure like power glove was widely rejected for its unwieldiness inaccuracy wii remote ir motion detection with accelerometry mario & sonic at olympic games wii game played by miming sports activity main article wii remote nintendo released wii sports sports game for wii console which player had physically move their wii remote move their avatar game contained five different sports—boxing bowling golf tennis baseball—which could all be played individually with multiple players players could also track their skill progress through game they became more proficient at different sports use training mode practice particular situations wii sports became second-highest selling video game all time wii sports opened way for other physically reactive sports-based video games such mario & sonic at olympic games first official title feature both mario sonic hedgehog which players used wii remote simulate running jumping other olympic sports nintendo released wii fit which allowed players do aerobic fitness exercises using wii balance board similar light saw release mario kart wii racing game which allowed player use their remote with wii wheel act steering wheel akin those on traditional arcade racing games sports games today sports genre currently dominated by ea sports 2k sports who hold licenses produce games based on official leagues eas franchises include fifa series nba live series madden football series nhl series tiger woods series all these games feature real leagues competitions players these games continue sell well today despite many product lines being over decade old receive for most part consistently good reviews with 2k & ea sports domination market has become very difficult enter competing games any above genres with exception racing games tend be unsuccessful this has led sharp drop sports-themed titles over recent years one most notable exceptions konamis pro evolution soccer series which often hailed alternative fifa series but does not contain many licensed teams players kits competitions another deviation from norm sonys mlb show series which now has monopoly on baseball genre after withdrawal 2k after mlb 2k13 racing games due variation that sport can offer terms tracks cars styles offer more room for competition selection games on offer has been considerably greater sports management games while not popular they used be live on through small independent software development houses management titles today have transitioned very popular fantasy sports leagues which are available through many websites such yahoo independent developers are also creating sports titles like super mega baseball golf club freestyle2 street basketball nintendo has been able make impact upon sports market by producing several mario-themed titles such super mario strikers mario hoops 3-on-3 mario tennis open mario golf world tour these titles sell respectfully but are only available on nintendos video game consoles for example nintendo gamecube nintendo nintendo 3ds wii wii u types this section does not cite any sources please help improve this section by adding citations

being able gain high score while compete against friends for free online has made online sports games very popular examples this include nfl blitz nba jam series simulation simulation games are more realistic than arcade games with emphasis being more on realism than on how fun game pick up play simulation games tend be slower more accurate while arcade games tend be fast can have all kinds ad-hoc rules ideas thrown especially pre-2000 for example nba jam had only two players on each team there was nes game where every bicycle kick performed no matter where field was made screen flash

language while possible write programs directly numerical machine code tedious error prone manage individual bits calculate numerical addresses constants manually for this reason machine code almost never used write programs almost all practical programs today are written higher-level languages assembly language source code then translated executable machine code by utilities such compilers

processor family has its own machine code instruction set instructions are patterns bits that by physical design correspond different commands machine thus instruction set specific class processors using mostly same architecture successor derivative processor designs often include all instructions predecessor may add additional instructions occasionally successor design will discontinue alter meaning some instruction code typically because needed for new purposes affecting code compatibility some extent even nearly completely compatible processors may show slightly different behavior for some instructions but this rarely problem systems may also differ other details such memory arrangement operating systems peripheral devices because program normally relies on such factors different systems will typically not run same machine code even when same type processor used machine code instruction set may have all instructions same length may have variable-length instructions how patterns are organized varies strongly with particular architecture often also with type instruction most instructions have one more opcode fields which specifies basic instruction type such arithmetic logical jump etc actual operation such add compare other fields that may give type operands addressing mode s addressing offsets index actual value itself such constant operands contained instruction are called immediates not all machines individual instructions have explicit operands accumulator machine has combined left operand result implicit accumulator for most arithmetic instructions other architectures such x86-family have accumulator versions common instructions with accumulator regarded one general registers by longer instructions stack machine has most all its operands on implicit stack special purpose instructions also often lack explicit operands cpuid x86 architecture writes values into four implicit destination registers for instance this distinction between explicit implicit operands important machine code generators especially register allocation live range tracking parts good code optimizer can track implicit well explicit operands which may allow more frequent constant propagation constant folding registers register assigned result constant expression freed up by replacing by that constant other code enhancements programs computer program sequence instructions that are executed by cpu while simple processors execute instructions one after another superscalar processors are capable executing several instructions at once program flow may be influenced by special jump instructions that transfer execution instruction other than numerically following one conditional jumps are taken execution continues at another address not

percussion mechanisms such striking bells clock was perfected long before invention piano these devices were later extended operate musical boxes which contain set tuned metal teeth plucked by player mechanism early musical instrument be automated was organ which comparatively easy operate automatically power for notes provided by air from bellows system organist player device only has operate valve control available air playing task ideally performed by pinned barrel art barrel organs was well advanced by mid-18th century piano complex instrument requiring each note be struck with different force control dynamics performance entire force required sound note must be given by performer hitting keys proved be difficult for player device combine variable percussive force controlled note duration barrels do not provide percussive force but relatively gentle switching motion early barrel pianos moved hammer back forwards continuously operator turned handle but hammers did not strike strings until moved slightly forwards by pin barrel hammers hit repeatedly until pin was removed this played note but at fixed dynamic with tremolo action quite unlike pianist development player piano was gradual overcoming various difficulties controlled percussive striking note duration earliest practical piano playing device was probably forneaux pianista which used compressed air inflate bellows when barrel pin opened valve this bellows struck piano key so played note acceleration developments leading pneumatic player device started 1840s began reach some recognizable device 1870s start player period can probably be seen centennial exposition philadelphia usa at this exhibition were number automatic player devices including pianista that contained elements which would lead player earliest description piano playing device using perforated paper rolls was claude seytres french patent concept was sound but device described was impractical way read roll operated piano alexander bain described device that used paper roll travelling valve that allowed air flow through reeds reed organ simple reed pipe organs using this sort system are still being produced however air flow not sufficient drive piano mechanism charles dawson england described more complex travelling valve device which added little bain hunt & bradish usa used roll read by sprung fingers springs being strong enough operate piano mechanism directly this device applied entire playing strength paper so would have shredded rapidly device would have had be wide piano keyboard pape england submitted patent that recognized need remove playing force from paper using light springs read roll activate more robust device which plays note — mechanical amplifier first device address practical requirement operating piano mechanism was forneauxs this recognized that hard strike was needed throw hammer towards keys used traditional barrel but tripped pneumatic device that inflated bellows rapidly operate note perforated cardboard book was substituted for barrel but was still read using sprung fingers this device entered manufacture generally regarded first practical player device was exhibited philadelphia van dusens american patent was first describe pneumatic striker operated by roll was probably based on work john mctammany leap thought occurred patent schmoele brothers they described double valve system that acted pneumatic amplifier reading roll electrically operating pneumatic with electromagnet they also exhibited at philadelphia with some modification pneumatic reading roll this would become final player piano some years later although schmoele brothers never benefited from john mctammany exhibited working player philadelphia that used paper roll read using sprung fingers whose slight movement triggered mechanical player device this operated reed organ mctammany had been experimenting since mid-1860s went on be one key names early player industry he claimed be inventor player but not player piano — important distinction philadelphia three working devices were exhibited that between them contained almost all components that final player piano would require however was be years before all these aspects were combined surprisingly missing component was pneumatic reading roll this was all probability due lack suitably flexible airtight

trackerboard music roll passes over trackerboard pianola was advertised one most high-profile campaigns ever making unprecedented use full-page color advertisements cost $250 £65 equivalent over $6000 £4000 money other cheaper makes were launched standard 65-note format evolved with 1⁄4 -inch-wide mm rolls holes spaced inch although several player manufacturers used their own form roll incompatible with other makes huge sums were spent by aeolian company had more than roll titles their catalog adding titles per month many companies catalogs ran thousands rolls mainly light religious classical music ragtime music did feature but not commonly this period player was being sold on its artistic capabilities rich buyers pioneer this decade was melville clark who introduced two key ideas full-scale roll which could play every note on piano keyboard internal player standard both ideas were ridiculed by his competitors unnecessary impractical but clark rapidly won both battles by end decade piano player device was obsolete was 65-note format this was major catastrophe for many small manufacturers who had spent all their capital on setting up 65-note player operations result was rapid consolidation industry new full-scale roll format playing all notes was agreed at industry conference buffalo so-called buffalo convention this kept 11¼-inch roll but now had smaller holes spaced at inch any player made anywhere world could now play any make roll understanding need for compatibility was defining moment player industry consensus was key avoiding costly format war which plagued almost every other form entertainment media that followed roll music while player piano matured america young inventor germany edwin welte was working on player which controlled all aspects performance automatically so that his machine would play back recorded performance exactly if original pianist was sitting at piano keyboard this device welte-mignon was launched created new marketing opportunities manufacturers could now get foremost pianists composers day record their performances on piano roll allowing owners player pianos experience such performance their own homes on their own instruments exactly original pianist had played from early days manufacturers sought create mechanisms which would pick out melody musical composition over background rest music same manner live pianist true player piano was designed be fully interactive musical experience rather than merely automatic instrument hence they are fitted with interactive control levers intended for player pianist pianolist create music performance their own taste player piano would provide aspiring pianists music lovers with technical dexterity they lacked while permitting them control musical performance interactively if they were accomplished pianist aeolian introduced metrostyle themodist latter being invention bringing out melody clearly above accompaniment with sales growing rapidly instruments themselves relatively mature this decade saw wider variety rolls become available two major advances were introduction hand-played roll both classical popular word roll hand-played rolls introduced musical phrasing into rolls so that player pianists did not have introduce through use tempo controls – something that few owners ever felt much inclination do word rolls significant innovation featured printed lyrics margins making simple use players accompany singing home very popular activity years before radio acceptable disc recordings became available other major advance was arrival major commercial rivals for welte-mignon ampico duo-art systems both launched around when world war i came german patents were seized us these two companies were left compete with each other england aeolian had huge factory sales network so easily outsold ampico estimated that perhaps 5% players sold were reproducing pianos america by end decade new jazz age rise fox-trot confirmed player piano instrument popular music with classical music increasingly relegated reproducing piano most american roll companies stopped offering large classical catalogs before abandoned instrumental rolls those without words within few years things were somewhat different england where aeolian company continued promote classical material receptive public word rolls never became norm england always being charged at 20% premium over non-word rolls result post-world war i american british roll collections look very different 1920–1930 1920–30 was decade that saw player piano reach its peak then its rapid decline peak sales instruments rolls were first few years decade at one point more than half all pianos being made america contained player unit player piano was not obscure by-line – was dominant force industry early 1920s many pianists note classical popular fields were called on make rolls little new technically arose through 1920s perhaps most significant was launch significantly improved form ampico system ampico b this was accompanied by automatic recording device that could record pianists note timings dynamics technical advances 1920s were instead largely radio technology key development there was introduction amplification so that was possible sit around radio listen family unlike earlier crystal sets which required use headphones amplification was also applied recording rpm records electrical recording systems introduced around allowing major rise sound quality radio these new records rapidly eroded market for player piano was declining from mid-1920s onwards novel attempts combine appeal player piano its new rivals were made by building radios and/or phonographs into player pianos themselves but even this could not entice public continue buying player pianos when wall street crash came october player piano was already very weak position sales effectively ceased only few well-capitalized companies continued business after this many these companies were result consolidation throughout 1920s which had already seen loss most names particularly roll-making field during this period player piano pneumatic technology was used basis for aircraft training simulators by inventor edwin albert link this device powered by suction bellows moved realistically response pilots operation controls link developed flight simulator his fathers binghamton new york factory which made coin-operated pianos for commercial establishments movie theater pipe organs link company commercialized device british equivalent was silloth trainer based on duo-art technology electronic descendants these devices are now widespread 1930–1950 few companies struggled on through 1930s aeolian purchased american piano company makers ampico bring capital business they sold off all their overseas assets so large piano factory at hayes was closed sold with one months notice gramophone company also based town joint aeolian-american operation stopped making new classical rolls concentrated on popular material final new rolls were issued late 1930s major survivor throughout this was qrs piano roll company originally offshoot melville clarkes operation owned by mid-1920s by max kortlander funded by his income composer qrs continued issue rolls all them created by j lawrence cook chief roll arranger from he supplemented his income postal worker thanks qrs roll repertoire available from 1930s 1940s other than qrs end 1930s had seen end player piano era lingering roll production england finally ceased when paper rationing made impossible continue aeolian duo-art recording machinery was destroyed by bombing during world war ii was welte factory freiburg however immediate aftermath war saw growth interest this lost era richard simonton purchased surviving welte-mignon rolls from edwin welte first disc recordings were made performances enthusiast era had tentatively begun 1950–present player piano performing during early 1950s number collectors began rescue player pianos all other instruments 1920s earlier amongst them was frank holland who formed his collection while working canada on returning england he located number like-minded enthusiasts started hold meetings at his house west london this was formalized the player piano group by early 1960s frank holland had formed british piano museum now musical museum brentford america another collector was harvey roehl who was so enthused by players that he published book called player piano treasury this sold by tens thousands was followed by books on how rebuild restore these instruments harvey roehls vestal press was major driving force raising awareness player piano within general population other societies worldwide were formed preserve study all aspects mechanical music such musical box society international mbsi automatic musical instruments collectors association amica usa max kortlander died unexpected heart attack qrs was run by his wife until she sold company ramsi tick whom found another stalwart champion whose business philosophy was not so much profit limit losses qrss presence ensured that owners newly awakened players could purchase rolls latest titles so ensuring that instrument remained current not just historical curiosity so great was revival that 1960s production player pianos started again aeolian revived pianola albeit this time small spinet piano suited post-war housing other manufacturers followed production has continued intermittently ever since qrs today offer traditional player piano their story clark piano recent years there has been greater focus on full rebuilding original instruments finally stop working early enthusiasts could often get by with limited patching but repair requirements have slowly risen although even this day possible find original 1920s instruments that still work after fashion – tribute their quality indication their continued popularity types steinway welte-mignon reproducing piano while there are many minor differences between manufacturers player piano piano that contains manually controlled pneumatically operating piano player mechanism intended that operator manually manipulates control levers order produce musical performance various aids human operator were developed split stack control these instruments vast majority all player pianos

instruments have peripheral pneumatic hardware systems fitted which when used conjunction with special music rolls are able highlight those notes score which are intended be accented away from those whose volume desired subdue basic theme pianos subdue all notes release full power only those notes which are aligned with special music roll theme perforations more subtle systems such hupfelds solodant aeolians themodist have graduated theme control where background subdued level foreground melody level are both controllable nature mechanism such that where chord occurs notes be emphasised have be advanced slightly away from their neighbors order for mechanism identify them isolated theme hardware these pianos able pick out melody notes away from their background accompaniment within entire range keyboard without necessity for breaking up chords ie software workaround manufacturers these systems were uk dalian kastonome us solo carola reproducing pianos these are fully automated versions player piano requiring no human manual control order produce illusion live musical performance this achieved by utilization music rolls where tempo mapping fully incorporated into music rolls ie note lengths live performance have been captured volume dynamics are created by peripheral pneumatic expression accessories under control from system-specific music roll coding this obviates need for human manipulation manual dynamic control levers typically electric motor provides power remove human operator from necessity provide motive power by treadling most reproducing pianos are capable

message rex lawson roll roll scanning has made significant advances recent years applying technology possibly most obvious yet hardest all conservation preservation topics replication aging disintegrating piano rolls roll scanning process reading music roll into computerized form that can be used for any purpose such cutting new rolls operating old new instruments directly this uses same technology domestic flatbed scanners hence term roll scanner ubiquity computers makes scanning fundamental preservation rolls all types well providing basis for secondary activities such operating instruments directly roll master re-creation process understanding how roll was originally manufactured so that errors arising from scanning are removed computer works same accuracy original perforators roll factory this allows exact replica rolls be made maximizes accuracy any secondary activity replication original master from which perforated paper roll was created highest aim roll scanning roll masters are not literally replicated because they were originally large cardboard rolls but re-created computerized form rationale that starting with master this form anything can be done with music – cut new rolls operate player pianos fitted with electronic valves simulate performance for playing on modern instruments – all without introducing any errors this case because virtually all rolls were punched fixed rows where punches will occur only one row next but never between roll effectively digital storage medium scanning simply counts distance from start roll each note event giving analogue hence inaccurate representation roll if instead rows are counted result exact representation original roll – perfect digital copy this can be done by applying knowledge about original rolls creation scan once master computerized copy has been recreated all information roll retained anything done after this can be done with accuracy original roll when using analogue version all its timing errors are carried through whatever you do with this particularly true when making recut rolls where imposing punch-row spacing perforator over different row spacing original roll causes surprisingly obvious audible errors however even analogue uses scan such operating instruments directly benefits from recreated master because way removes timing errors from basic scan so doing allows accuracy scanner itself be calibrated roll scanning itself not major significance – simply adds optical technology pneumatic electrical mechanical technologies previously used extract

reliable sources unsourced material may be challenged removed august learn how when remove this template message syntax highlighting indent style are often used aid programmers recognizing elements source code color coded highlighting used this piece code written python computer science syntax computer language set rules that defines combinations symbols that are considered be correctly structured document fragment that language this applies both programming languages where document represents source code markup languages where document represents data syntax language defines its surface form text-based computer languages are based on sequences characters while visual programming languages are based on spatial layout connections between symbols which may be textual graphical documents that are syntactically invalid are said have syntax error syntax – form – contrasted with semantics – meaning processing computer languages semantic processing generally comes after syntactic processing but some cases semantic processing necessary for complete syntactic analysis these are done together concurrently compiler syntactic analysis comprises frontend while semantic analysis comprises backend middle end if this phase distinguished contents levels syntax o examples errors syntax definition o example lisp o complex grammars syntax versus semantics see also references external links levels syntax computer language syntax generally distinguished into three levels words – lexical level determining how characters form tokens phrases – grammar level narrowly speaking determining how tokens form phrases context – determining what objects variables names refer if types are valid etc distinguishing this way yields modularity allowing each level be described processed separately often independently first lexer turns linear sequence characters into linear sequence tokens this known lexical analysis lexing second parser turns linear sequence tokens into hierarchical syntax tree this known parsing narrowly speaking thirdly contextual analysis resolves names checks types this modularity sometimes possible but many real-world languages earlier step depends on later step – for example lexer hack c because tokenization depends on context even these cases syntactical analysis often seen approximating this ideal model parsing stage itself can be divided into two parts parse tree concrete syntax tree which determined by grammar but generally far too detailed for practical use abstract syntax tree ast which simplifies this into usable form ast contextual analysis steps can be considered form semantic analysis they are adding meaning interpretation syntax alternatively informal manual implementations syntactical rules that would be difficult awkward describe implement formally levels generally correspond levels chomsky hierarchy words are regular language specified lexical grammar which type-3 grammar generally given regular expressions phrases are context-free language cfl generally deterministic context-free language dcfl specified phrase structure grammar which type-2 grammar generally given production rules backus–naur form bnf phrase grammars are often specified much more constrained grammars than full context-free grammars order make them easier parse while lr parser can parse any dcfl linear time simple lalr parser even simpler ll parser are more efficient but can only parse grammars whose production rules are constrained contextual structure can principle be described by context-sensitive grammar automatically analyzed by means such attribute grammars though general this step done manually via name resolution rules type checking implemented via symbol table which stores names types for each scope tools have been written that automatically generate lexer from lexical specification written regular expressions parser from phrase grammar written bnf this allows one use declarative programming rather than need have procedural functional programming notable example lex-yacc pair these automatically produce concrete syntax tree parser writer must then manually write code describing how this converted abstract syntax tree contextual analysis also generally implemented manually despite existence these automatic tools parsing often implemented manually for various reasons – perhaps phrase structure not context-free alternative implementation improves performance error-reporting allows grammar be changed more easily parsers are often written functional languages such haskell scripting languages such python perl c c++ examples errors main article syntax error example add syntactically valid lisp program assuming add function exists else name resolution fails adding however following are invalid lexical error  not valid add parsing error missing closing  note that lexer unable identify first error – all knows that after producing token leftparen  remainder program invalid since no word rule begins with  second error detected at parsing stage parser has identified list production rule due  token only match thus can give error message general may be ambiguous type errors undeclared variable errors are sometimes considered be syntax errors when they are detected at compile-time which usually case when compiling strongly-typed languages though common classify these kinds error semantic errors instead example python code a + contains type error because adds string literal integer literal type errors this kind can be detected at compile-time they can be detected during parsing phrase analysis if compiler uses separate rules that allow integerliteral + integerliteral but not stringliteral + integerliteral though more likely that compiler will use parsing rule that allows all expressions form literaloridentifier + literaloridentifier then error will be detected during contextual analysis when type checking occurs some cases this validation not done by compiler these errors are only detected at runtime weakly typed language where type can only be determined at runtime many type errors can only be detected at runtime for example python code + b syntactically valid at phrase level but correctness types b can only be determined at runtime variables do not have types python only values do whereas there disagreement about whether type error detected by compiler should be called syntax error rather than static semantic error type errors which can only be detected at program execution time are always regarded semantic rather than syntax errors syntax definition parse tree python code with inset tokenization syntax textual programming languages usually defined using combination regular expressions for lexical structure backus–naur form for grammatical structure inductively specify syntactic categories nonterminals terminal symbols syntactic categories are defined by rules called productions which specify values that belong particular syntactic category terminal symbols are concrete characters strings characters for example keywords such define if let void from which syntactically valid programs are constructed language can have different equivalent grammars such equivalent regular expressions at lexical levels different phrase rules which generate same language using broader category grammars such lr grammars can allow shorter simpler grammars compared with more restricted categories such ll grammar which may require longer grammars with more rules different but equivalent phrase grammars yield different parse trees though underlying language set valid documents same example lisp below simple grammar defined using notation regular expressions backus–naur form describes syntax lisp which defines productions for syntactic categories expression atom number symbol list expression = atom | list atom = number | symbol number = + symbol = list =  expression  this grammar specifies following expression either atom list atom either number symbol number unbroken sequence one more decimal digits optionally preceded by plus minus sign symbol letter followed by zero more any characters excluding whitespace list matched pair parentheses with zero more expressions inside here decimal digits upper- lower-case characters parentheses are terminal symbols following are examples well-formed token sequences this grammar 12345  a b c232 1 complex grammars grammar needed specify programming language can be classified by its position chomsky hierarchy phrase grammar most programming languages can be specified using type-2 grammar ie they are context-free grammars though overall syntax context-sensitive due variable declarations nested scopes hence type-1 however there are exceptions for some languages phrase grammar type-0 turing-complete some languages like perl lisp specification implementation language allows constructs that execute during parsing phase furthermore these languages have constructs that allow programmer alter behavior parser this combination effectively blurs distinction between parsing execution makes syntax analysis undecidable problem these languages meaning that parsing phase may not finish for example perl possible execute code during parsing using begin statement perl function prototypes may alter syntactic interpretation possibly even syntactic validity remaining code colloquially this referred only perl can parse perl because code must be executed during parsing can modify grammar more strongly even perl cannot parse perl because undecidable similarly lisp macros introduced by defmacro syntax also execute during parsing meaning that lisp compiler must have entire lisp run-time system present contrast c macros are merely string replacements do not require code execution syntax versus semantics syntax language describes form valid program but does not provide any information about meaning program results executing that program meaning given combination symbols handled by semantics either formal hard-coded reference implementation not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed per languages rules may depending on language specification soundness implementation result error on translation execution some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when program well-defined within language may still have meaning that not intended by person who wrote using natural language example may not be possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may be false colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically well formed but has no generally accepted meaning john married bachelor grammatically well

industry has seen rise recent years with growth new online distribution systems mobile game market first video games were developed 1960s but required mainframe computers were not available general public commercial game development began 1970s with advent first generation video game consoles home computers due low costs low capabilities computers lone programmer could develop full game however approaching 21st century ever-increasing computer processing power heightened consumer expectations made difficult for single developer produce mainstream console pc game average cost producing video game slowly rose from us$1–4 million over $5 million then over $20 million by mainstream pc console games are generally developed phases first pre-production pitches prototypes game design documents

developed creative outlet generate profit development normally funded by publisher well-made games bring profit more readily however important estimate games financial requirements such development costs individual features failing provide clear implications games expectations may result exceeding allocated budget fact majority commercial games do not produce profit most developers cannot afford changing development schedule require estimating their capabilities with available resources before production game industry requires innovations publishers cannot profit from constant release repetitive sequels imitations every year new independent development companies open some manage develop hit titles similarly many developers close down because they cannot find publishing contract their production not profitable difficult start new company due high initial investment required nevertheless growth casual mobile game market has allowed developers with smaller teams enter market once companies become financially stable they may expand develop larger games most developers start small gradually expand their business developer receiving profit from successful title may store up capital expand re-factor their company well tolerate more failed deadlines average development budget for multiplatform game us$18-28m with high-profile games often exceeding $40m early era home computers video game consoles early 1980s single programmer could handle almost all tasks developing game — programming graphical design sound effects etc could take little six weeks develop game however high user expectations requirements modern commercial games far exceed capabilities single developer require splitting responsibilities team over hundred people can be employed full-time for single project game development production design process that starts from idea concept often idea based on modification existing game concept game idea may fall within one several genres designers often experiment with different combinations genres game designer usually produces initial game proposal document that contains concept gameplay feature list setting story target audience requirements schedule staff budget estimates different companies have different formal procedures philosophies regarding game design development there no standardized development method however commonalities exist game development undertaken by game developer—ranging from individual large company there can be independent publisher-owned studios independent developers rely on financial support from game publisher they usually have develop game from concept prototype without external funding formal game proposal then submitted publishers who may finance game development from several months years publisher would retain exclusive rights distribute market game would often own intellectual property rights for game franchise publishers company may also own developers company may have internal development studios generally publisher one who owns games intellectual property rights all but smallest developer companies work on several titles at once this necessary because time taken between shipping game receiving royalty payments which may be between months small companies may structure contracts ask for advances on royalties use shareware distribution employ part-time workers use other methods meet payroll demands console manufacturers such microsoft nintendo sony have standard set technical requirements that game must conform order be approved additionally game concept must be approved by manufacturer who may refuse approve certain titles most modern pc console games take from one three years complete where mobile game can be developed few months length development influenced by number factors such genre scale development platform amount assets some games can take much longer than average time frame complete infamous example realms duke nukem forever announced be production april released fourteen years later june planning for maxis game spore began late game was released nine years later september game prey was briefly profiled issue pc gamer but was not released until only then highly altered form finally team fortress was development from until its release emerged from convoluted development process involving probably three four different games according gabe newell game revenue from retails divided among parties along distribution chain such — developer publisher retail manufacturer console royalty many developers fail profit from this go bankrupt many developers seek alternative economic models through internet marketing distribution channels improve returns through mobile distribution channel share developer can be up 70% total revenue through online distribution channel almost 100% history further information history game development xgs pic 16-bit game development board game development tool similar those used 1990s history game making begins with development first video games although which video game first depends on definition video game first games created had little entertainment value their development focus was separate from user experience—in fact these games required mainframe computers play them oxo written by alexander s douglas was first computer game use digital display game called tennis for two which displayed its output on oscilloscope was made by willy higinbotham physicist working at brookhaven national laboratory mainframe computer game called spacewar was developed by group massachusetts institute technology students led by steve russell true commercial design development games began 1970s when arcade video games first-generation consoles were marketed computer space was first commercially sold coin-operated video game used black-and-white television for its display computer system was made series ttl chips first home console system was released called magnavox odyssey developed by ralph h baer that same year atari released pong arcade game that increased video game popularity commercial success pong led other companies develop pong clones spawning video game industry programmers worked within big companies produce games for these devices industry did not see huge innovation game design large number consoles had very similar games many these early games were often pong clones some games were different however such gun fight which was significant for several reasons early on-foot multi-directional shooter which depicted game characters game violence human-to-human combat tomohiro nishikados original version was based on discrete logic which dave nutting adapted using intel making first video game use microprocessor console manufacturers soon started produce consoles that were able play independently developed games ran on microprocessors marking beginning second-generation consoles beginning with release fairchild channel f flood pong clones led video game crash which eventually came end with mainstream success taitos arcade shooter game space invaders marking beginning golden age arcade video games inspiring dozens manufacturers enter market its creator nishikado not only designed programmed game but also did artwork engineered arcade hardware put together microcomputer from scratch was soon ported atari becoming first killer app quadrupling consoles sales at same time home computers appeared on market allowing individual programmers hobbyists develop games this allowed hardware manufacturer software manufacturers act separately very large amount games could be produced by single individuals games were easy make because graphical memory limitation did not allow for much content larger companies developed who focused selected teams work on title developers many early home video games such zork baseball air warrior adventure later transitioned their work products early video game industry “ i wouldnt recommend for someone with weak heart large appetite ” — jon freeman industry expanded significantly at time with arcade video game sector alone representing largest share gaming industry generating higher revenues than both pop music hollywood films combined home video game industry however suffered major losses following north american video game crash jon freeman warned computer gaming world q are computer games way fame fortune no not unless your idea fame having your name recognized by one two astute individuals at origins ive been making living after fashion designing games for most last six years i wouldnt recommend for someone with weak heart large appetite though chris crawford don daglow similarly advised prospective designers write games hobby first not quit their existing jobs early home video game industry was revitalized soon after by widespread success nintendo entertainment system by video game required months develop another six plan marketing projects remained usually solo efforts with single developers delivering finished games their publishers with ever-increasing processing graphical capabilities arcade console computer products along with increase user expectations game design moved beyond scope single developer produce marketable game reasonable time this sparked beginning team-based development broad terms during 1980s pre-production involved sketches test routines only developer 1990s pre-production consisted mostly game art previews early 2000s pre-production usually produced playable demo month development project was funded by publisher for us$1m–3m additionally $250k–15m were spent on marketing sales development over games were released for pc from about games turning profit only about made significant profit early 2000s became increasingly common use middleware game engines such quake engine unreal engine early 2000s also mobile games started gain popularity however mobile games distributed by mobile operators remained marginal form gaming until apple app store was launched mainstream console video game cost from us$3m $6m develop some games cost much $20m develop profit from console game sold at retail was divided among parties distribution chain follows developer 13% publisher 32% retail 32% manufacturer 5% console royalty 18% developer would retain around 17% retail price around 85% if sold online since third generation consoles home video game industry has constantly increased expanded industry revenue has increased at least five-fold since 1990s software portion video game revenue was $95 billion exceeding that movie industry apple app store introduced was first mobile application store operated directly by mobile platform holder significantly changed consumer behaviour more favourable for downloading mobile content quickly broadened markets mobile games games market annual value was estimated between $7–30 billion depending on which sales figures are included this on par with films box office market publisher would typically fund independent developer for $500k–$5m for development title total value had already reached $663 billion by then video game markets were not anymore dominated by console games according newzoo share mmos was 198% pc/macs 98% tablets 32% smartphones 106% handhelds 98% consoles only 367% online casual games 102% fastest growing market segments being mobile games with average annual rate 19% for smartphones 48% for tablets past several years many developers opened many closed down each year number developers are acquired by larger companies merge with existing companies for example blizzard entertainments parent company vivendi games merged with activision electronic arts nearly acquired take-two

director publisher main article video game publisher ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding april video game publisher company that publishes video games that they have either developed internally have had developed by external video game developer with book publishers publishers dvd movies video game publishers are responsible for their products manufacturing marketing including market research all aspects advertising they usually finance development sometimes by paying video game developer publisher calls this external development sometimes by paying internal staff developers called studio consequently they also typically own ip game large video game publishers also distribute games they publish while some smaller publishers instead hire distribution companies larger video game publishers distribute games they publish other functions usually performed by publisher include deciding on paying for any license that game may utilize paying for localization layout printing possibly writing user manual creation graphic design elements such box design large publishers may also attempt boost efficiency across all internal external development teams by providing services such sound design code packages for commonly needed functionality because publisher usually finances development usually tries manage development risk with staff producers project managers monitor progress developer critique ongoing development assist necessary most video games created by external video game developer are paid for with periodic advances on royalties these advances are paid when developer reaches certain stages development called milestones independent video game developers create games without publisher may choose digitally distribute their games development team developers can range size from small groups making casual games housing hundreds employees producing several large titles companies divide their subtasks games development individual job titles may vary however roles are same within industry development team consists several members some members team may handle more than one role similarly more than one task may be handled by same member team size can vary from more members depending on games scope most represented are artists followed by programmers then designers finally audio specialists with two three producers management these positions are employed full-time other positions such testers may be employed only part-time salaries for these positions vary depending on both experience location employee entry-level programmer can make on average around $70000 annually experienced programmer can make on average around $125000 annually development team includes these roles disciplines designer further information

such scripting planning rule-based decisions etc graphics – managing graphical content utilization memory considerations production graphics engine integration models textures work along physics engine sound – integration music speech effect sounds into proper locations times gameplay – implementation various games rules features sometimes called generalist scripting – development maintenance high-level command system for various in-game tasks such ai level editor triggers etc ui – production user interface elements like option menus huds help feedback systems etc input processing – processing compatibility correlation various input devices such keyboard mouse gamepad etc network communications – managing data inputs outputs for local internet gameplay game tools – production tools accompany development game especially for designers scripters level designer further information level design level designer person who creates levels challenges missions for computer and/or video games using specific set programs these programs may be commonly available commercial design programs specially designed tailored level editors made for specific game level designers work with both incomplete complete versions game game programmers usually produce level editors design tools for designers use this eliminates need for designers access modify game code level editors may involve custom high-level scripting languages for interactive environments ais opposed level editing tools sometimes available community level designers often work with placeholders prototypes aiming for consistency clear layout before required artwork completed sound engineer sound engineers are technical professionals responsible for sound effects sound positioning they sometimes oversee voice acting other sound asset creation composers who create games musical score also comprise games sound team though often this work outsourced tester further information game testing quality assurance carried out by game testers game tester analyzes video games document software defects part quality control testing highly technical field requiring computing expertise analytic competence testers ensure that game falls within proposed design both works entertainingthis involves testing all features compatibility localization etc although necessary throughout whole development process testing expensive often actively utilized only towards completion project development process game development software development process video game software with art audio gameplay formal software development methods are often overlooked games with poor development methodology are likely run over budget time estimates well contain large number bugs planning important for individual group projects alike overall game development not suited for typical software life cycle methods such waterfall model one method employed for game development agile development based on iterative prototyping subset software prototyping agile development depends on feedback refinement games iterations with gradually increasing feature set this method effective because most projects do not start with clear requirement outline popular method agile software development scrum another successful method personal software process psp requiring additional training for staff increase awareness projects planning this method more expensive requires commitment team members psp can be extended team software process where whole team self-directing game development usually involves overlap these methods for example asset creation may be done via waterfall model because requirements specification are clear but gameplay design might be done using iterative prototyping development commercial game usually includes following stages pre-production pre-production design phase planning phase project focused on idea concept development production initial design documents goal concept development produce clear easy understand documentation which describes all tasks schedules estimates for development team suite documents produced this phase called production plan this phase usually not funded by publisher however good publishers may require developers produce plans during pre-production concept documentation can be separated into three stages documents—high concept pitch concept however there no industry standard naming convention for example both bethke bates refer pitch document game proposal yet moore novak refers concept document game proposal late stage pre-production may also be referred proof concept technical review when more detailed game documents are produced publishers have started expect broader game proposals even featuring playable prototypes high concept high concept brief description game pitch pitch concept document proposal document game proposal short summary document intended present games selling points detail why game would be profitable develop verbal pitches may be made management within developer company then presented publishers written document may need be shown publishers before funding approved game proposal may undergo one several green-light meetings with publisher executives who determine if game be developed presentation project often given by game designers demos may be created for pitch however may be unnecessary for established developers with good track records if developer acts its own publisher both companies are subsidiaries single company then only upper management needs give approval concept concept document game proposal game plan more detailed document than pitch document this includes all information produced about game this includes high concept games genre gameplay description features setting story target audience hardware platforms estimated schedule marketing analysis team requirements risk analysis before approved design completed skeleton crew programmers artists usually begins work programmers may develop quick-and-dirty prototypes showcasing one more features that stakeholders would like see incorporated final product artists may develop concept art asset sketches springboard for developing real game assets producers may work part-time on game at this point scaling up for full-time commitment development progresses game producers work during pre-production related planning schedule budget estimating tasks with team producer aims create solid production plan so that no delays are experienced at start production game design document main article game design document before full-scale production can begin development team produces first version game design document incorporating all most material from initial pitch design document describes games concept major gameplay elements detail may also include preliminary sketches various aspects game design document sometimes accompanied by functional prototypes some sections game design document remains living document throughout development—often changed weekly even daily compiling list games needs called requirement capture prototype placeholder graphics are characteristic early game prototypes writing prototypes gameplay ideas features important activity that allows programmers game designers experiment with different algorithms usability scenarios for game great deal prototyping may take place during pre-production before design document complete may fact help determine what features design specifies when this happens prototype made physical not on computer this so easier test make changes before wasting time resources into what could be canceled idea project prototyping may also take place during active development test new ideas game emerges prototypes are often meant only act proof concept test ideas by adding modifying removing some features most algorithms features debuted prototype may be ported game once they have been completed often prototypes need be developed quickly with very little time for up-front design around minutes testing therefore usually very prolific programmers are called upon quickly code these testbed tools rad tools may be used aid quick development these programs case prototype physical form programmers designers alike will make game with paper dice other easy access tools order make prototype faster successful development model iterative prototyping where design refined based on current progress there are various technology available for video game development production production main stage development when assets source code for game are produced mainstream production usually defined period time when project fully staffed programmers write new source code artists develop game assets such sprites models sound engineers develop sound effects composers develop music for game level designers create levels writers write dialogue for cutscenes npcs game designers continue develop games design throughout production design main article game design game design essential collaborative process designing content rules game requiring artistic technical competence well writing skills creativity open mindness vital for completion successful video game during development game designer implements modifies game design reflect current vision game features levels are often removed added art treatment may evolve backstory may change new platform may be targeted well new demographic all these changes need be documented disseminated rest team most changes occur updates design document programming main article game programming programming game handled by one more game programmers they develop prototypes test ideas many which may never make into final game programmers incorporate new features demanded by game design fix any bugs introduced during development process even if off-the-shelf game engine used great deal programming required customize almost every game level creation main article level design from time standpoint games first level takes longest develop level designers artists use tools for level building they request features changes in-house tools that allow for quicker higher quality development newly introduced features may cause old levels become obsolete so levels developed early on may be repeatedly developed discarded because dynamic environment game development design early levels may also change over time not uncommon spend upwards twelve months on one level game developed over course three years later levels can be developed much more quickly feature set more complete game vision clearer more stable art production main article game art design ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding april audio production game audio may be separated into three categories—sound effects music voice-over sound effect production production sounds by either tweaking sample desired effect replicating with real objects sound effects are important impact games delivery music may be synthesized performed live there are several ways which music presented game music may be ambient especially for slow periods game where music aims reinforce aesthetic mood game setting music may be triggered by in-game events for example such games pac-man mario player picking up power-ups triggered respective musical scores action music such chase battle hunting sequences fast-paced hard-changing score menu music similar credits music creates aural impact while relatively little action taking place game title with hours single-player gameplay may feature around minutes music voice-overs voice acting creates character gameplay interactivity voice acting adds personality games characters testing main article game testing at end project quality assurance plays significant role testers start work once anything playable this may be one level subset game software that can be used any reasonable extent early on testing game occupies relatively small amount time testers may work on several games at once development draws close single game usually employs many testers full-time often with overtime they strive test new features regression test existing ones testing vital for modern complex games single changes may lead catastrophic consequences at this time features levels are being finished at highest rate there more new material be tested than during any other time project testers need carry out regression testing make sure that features that have been place for months still operate correctly regression testing one vital tasks required for effective software development new features are added subtle changes codebase can produce unexpected changes different portions game this task often overlooked for several reasons sometimes when feature implemented tested considered working for rest project little attention given repeated testing also features that are added late development are prioritized existing features often receive insufficient testing time proper regression testing also increasingly expensive number features increases often not scheduled correctly despite dangers overlooking regression testing some game developers publishers fail test full feature suite game ship game with bugs this can result customers dissatisfaction failure meet sales goals when this does happen most developers publishers quickly release patches that fix bugs make game fully playable again milestones commercial game development projects may be required meet milestones set by publisher milestones mark major events during game development are used track games progress such milestones may be for example first playable alpha beta game versions project milestones depend on developer schedules there no industry standard for defining milestones such vary depending on publisher year project some common milestones for two-year development cycle are follows first playable first playable game version containing representative gameplay assets this first version with functional major gameplay elements often based on prototype created pre-production alpha first playable are sometimes used refer single milestone however large projects require first playable before feature complete alpha first playable occurs months before code release sometimes referred pre-alpha stage alpha see also alpha release alpha stage when key gameplay functionality implemented assets are partially finished game alpha feature complete that game playable contains all major features these features may be further revised based on testing feedback additional small new features may be added similarly planned but unimplemented features may be dropped programmers focus mainly on finishing codebase rather than implementing additions alpha occurs eight ten months before code release but this can vary significantly based on scope content assets any given game has code freeze code freeze stage when new code no longer added game only bugs are being corrected code freeze occurs three four months before code release beta see also beta release beta feature asset complete version game when only bugs are being fixed this version contains no bugs that prevent game from being shippable no changes are made game features assets code beta occurs two three months before code release code release code release stage when many bugs are fixed game ready be shipped submitted for console manufacturer review this version tested against qa test plan first code release candidate usually ready three four weeks before code release gold master see also release manufacturing gold master final games build that used master for production game crunch time overtime expected games industry particularly crunch time crunch mode unpaid overtime requested by many companies meet project deadlines milestones that negatively affects game developers team missing deadline risks danger having project cancelled employees being laid off although many companies are reducing amount crunch time still prominent smaller companies many companies offer time-off called comp time extra paid time off after product ships compensate for crunch times negative effects some companies offer bonuses financial rewards for successful milestone reach sometimes on-site crunch meals are offered delivered team during crunch time international game developers association igda surveyed nearly game developers produced report highlight many problems caused by bad practice post-production after game goes gold ships some developers will give team members comp time perhaps up week two compensate for overtime put complete game though this compensation not standard maintenance once game ships maintenance phase for video game begins games developed for video game consoles have had almost no maintenance period past shipped game would forever house many bugs features when released this was common for consoles since all consoles had identical nearly identical hardware making incompatibility cause many bugs non-issue this case maintenance would only occur case port sequel enhanced remake that reuses large portion engine assets recent times popularity online console games has grown online capable video game consoles online services such xbox live for xbox have developed developers can maintain their software through downloadable patches these changes would not have been possible past without widespread availability internet pc development different game developers try account for majority configurations hardware however number possible configurations hardware software inevitably leads discovery game-breaking circumstances that programmers testers didnt account for programmers wait for period get many bug reports possible once developer thinks theyve obtained enough feedback programmers start working on patch patch may take weeks months develop but its intended fix most accounted bugs problems with game that were overlooked past code release rare cases fix unintended problems caused by previous patches occasionally patch may include extra features content may even alter gameplay case massively multiplayer online game mmog such mmorpg mmorts shipment game starting phase maintenance such online games are continuous maintenance gameworld continuously changed iterated new features are added maintenance staff for popular mmog can number dozens sometimes including members original programming team outsourcing several development disciplines such audio dialogue motion capture occur for relatively short periods time efficient employment these roles requires either large development house with multiple simultaneous title production outsourcing from third-party vendors employing personnel for these tasks full-time expensive so majority developers outsource portion work outsourcing plans are conceived during pre-production stage where time finances required for outsourced work are estimated music cost ranges based on length composition method performance live synthesized composer experience minute high quality synthesized music cost between us$ 600-15k title with hours gameplay minutes music may have cost $50k-60k for its musical score voice acting well-suited for outsourcing requires set specialized skills only large publishers employ in-house voice actors sound effects can also be outsourced programming generally outsourced less than other disciplines such art music however outsourcing for extra programming work savings salaries has become more common recent years marketing game production has similar distribution methods those music film industries publishers marketing team targets game for specific market then advertises team advises developer on target demographics market trends well suggests specific features game then advertised games high concept incorporated into promotional material ranging from magazine ads tv spots communication between developer marketing important length purpose game demo depends on purpose demo target audience games demo may range between few seconds such clips screenshots hours gameplay demo usually intended for journalists buyers trade shows general public internal employees who for example may need familiarize with game promote demos are produced with public relations marketing sales mind maximizing presentation effectiveness trade show demo game nears completion publisher will want showcase demo title at trade shows many games have trade show demo scheduled major annual trade shows are for example electronic entertainment expo e3 penny arcade expo pax e3 largest show north america e3 hosted primarily for marketing business deals new games platforms are announced at e3 received broad press coverage thousands products are on display press demonstration schedules are kept recent years e3 has become more closed-door event many advertisers have withdrawn reducing e3s budget pax created by authors penny arcade blog web-comic mature playful event with player-centred philosophy localization main article video game localization game created one language may also be published other countries which speak different language for that region game needs be translated for game be playable for example some games created for playstation vita were initially published japanese language like soul sacrifice non-native speakers games original language may have wait for translation game their language but most modern big-budget games take localization into account during development process games are released for several different languages simultaneously localization actual process translating language assets game into other languages by localizing games they increase their level accessibility where games could help expend international markets effectively game localization generally known language translations yet full localization game complex project different levels translation range from zero translation being that there no translation product all things are sent raw basic translation where only few text subtitles are translated even added full translation where new voice overs game material changes are added there are various essential elements on localizing game including translating language game adjusting in-game assets for different cultures reach more potential consumers other geographies globalization for short translation seems fall into scope localization which itself constitutes substantially broader endeavor these include different levels translation globalization game itself however certain developers seem be divided on whether globalization falls under localization not moreover order fit into local markets game production companies often change redesign graphic designs packaging game for marketing purposes for example popular game assassins creed has two different packaging designs for japanese us market by localizing graphic packaging designs companies might arouse better connections attention from consumers from various regions indie development main article independent video game development independent games indie games are produced by individuals small teams with no large-scale developer publisher affiliations indie developers generally rely on internet distribution schemes many hobbyist indie developers create mods existing games indie developers are credited for creative game ideas for example darwinia weird worlds world goo current economic viability indie development questionable however recent years internet delivery platforms such xbox live arcade steam have improved indie game success fact some indie games have become very successful such braid world goo minecraft game industry main article video game industry video game industry formally referred interactive entertainment economic sector involved with development marketing sale video games industry sports several unique approaches examples perspective this section may not represent worldwide view subject you may improve this article discuss issue on talk page create new article appropriate september learn how when remove this template message culture game development culture always has been continues be very casual by normal business standards many game developers are strongly individualistic usually tolerant divergent personalities despite casual culture game development taken seriously by its practitioners who may take offense if suggested that they dont have real job locales united states further information list video game companies united states early history video game development prominent locale for game development was corridor from san francisco silicon valley california most new developers us open near such hot beds at present many large publishers still operate there such activision blizzard capcom entertainment disney interactive eidos interactive electronic arts foundation lucasarts entertainment namco bandai games sega america sony computer entertainment america thq however due nature game development many publishers are present other regions such big fish games washington garagegames oregon majesco new jersey microsoft corporation washington nintendo america washington take-two interactive new york southpeak interactive virginia education many universities design schools are offering classes specifically focused on game development some have built strategic alliances with major game development companies these alliances ensure that students have access latest technologies are provided opportunity find jobs within gaming industry once qualified many innovative ideas are presented at conferences such independent games festival igf game developers conference gdc indie game development may motivate students who produce game for their final projects thesis may open their own game company universities offer computer science degrees which give you strong basis knowledge if you wish become programmer stability video game industry employment fairly volatile similar other artistic industries including television music etc scores game development studios crop up work on one game then quickly go under this may be one reason why game developers tend congregate geographically if their current studio goes under developers can flock adjacent one start another from ground up industry where only top 20%

utilization robots by modularizing their architecture functionality effectiveness modular robot easier increase compared conventional robots these robots are composed single type identical several different identical module types similarly shaped modules which vary size their architectural structure allows hyper-redundancy for modular robots they can be designed with more than degrees freedom dof creating programming inverse kinematics dynamics for modular robots more complex than with traditional robots modular robots may be composed l-shaped modules cubic modules u h-shaped modules anat technology early modular robotic technology patented by robotics design inc allows creation modular robots from u h shaped modules that connect chain are used form heterogeneous homogenous modular robot systems these “anat robots” can be designed with “n” dof each module complete motorized robotic system that folds relatively modules connected before after its chain therefore single module allows one degree freedom more modules that are connected one another more degrees freedom will have l-shaped modules can also be designed chain must become increasingly smaller size chain increases payloads attached end chain place greater strain on modules that are further from base anat h-shaped modules do not suffer from this problem their design allows modular robot distribute pressure impacts evenly amongst other attached modules therefore payload-carrying capacity does not decrease length arm increases modular robots can be manually self-reconfigured form different robot that may perform different applications because modular robots same architecture type are composed modules that compose different modular robots snake-arm robot can combine with another form dual quadra-arm robot can split into several mobile robots mobile robots can split into multiple smaller ones combine with others into larger different one this allows single modular robot ability be fully specialized single task well capacity be specialized perform multiple different tasks modular robotic technology currently being applied hybrid transportation industrial automation duct cleaning

robots are smarter than humans he calls this singularity he suggests that may be somewhat possibly very dangerous for humans this discussed by philosophy called singularitarianism experts attended conference hosted by association for advancement artificial intelligence aaai discuss whether computers robots might be able acquire any autonomy how much these abilities might pose threat hazard they noted that some robots have acquired various forms semi-autonomy including being able find power sources on their own being able independently choose targets attack with weapons they also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination have achieved cockroach intelligence they noted that self-awareness depicted science-fiction probably unlikely but that there were other potential hazards pitfalls various media sources scientific groups have noted separate trends differing areas which might together result greater robotic functionalities autonomy which pose some inherent concerns nao alderen robots were shown have capability for degree self-awareness researchers at rensselaer polytechnic institute ai reasoning lab new york conducted experiment where robot became aware itself corrected its answer question once had realised this military robots some experts academics have questioned use robots for military combat especially when such robots are given some degree autonomous functions there are also concerns about technology which might allow some armed robots be controlled mainly by other robots us navy has funded report which indicates that military robots become more complex there should be greater attention implications their ability make autonomous decisions one researcher states that autonomous robots might be more humane they could make decisions more effectively however other experts question this one robot particular eatr has generated public concerns over its fuel source can continually refuel itself using organic substances although engine for eatr designed run on biomass vegetation specifically selected by its sensors which can find on battlefields other local environments project has stated that chicken fat can also be used manuel de landa has noted that smart missiles autonomous bombs equipped with artificial perception can be considered robots they make some their decisions autonomously he believes this represents important dangerous trend which humans are handing over important decisions machines relationship unemployment main article technological unemployment for centuries experts have predicted that machines would make workers obsolete increase unemployment recent example human replacement involves taiwanese technology company foxconn who july announced three-year plan replace workers with more robots at present company uses ten thousand robots but will increase them million robots over three-year period lawyers have speculated that increased prevalence robots workplace could lead need revise redundancy laws contemporary uses general-purpose robot acts guide during day security guard at night see also list robots at present there are two main types robots based on their use general-purpose autonomous robots dedicated robots robots can be classified by their specificity purpose robot might be designed perform one particular task extremely well range tasks less well course all robots by their nature can be re-programmed behave differently but some are limited by their physical form for example factory robot arm can perform jobs such cutting welding gluing acting fairground ride while pick-and-place robot can only populate printed circuit boards general-purpose autonomous robots main article autonomous robot general-purpose autonomous robots can perform variety functions independently general-purpose autonomous robots typically can navigate independently known spaces handle their own re-charging needs interface with electronic doors elevators perform other basic tasks like computers general-purpose robots can link with networks software accessories that increase their usefulness they may recognize people objects talk provide companionship monitor environmental quality respond alarms pick up supplies perform other useful tasks general-purpose robots may perform variety functions simultaneously they may take on different roles at different times day some such robots try mimic human beings may even resemble people appearance this type robot called humanoid robot humanoid robots are still very limited stage no humanoid robot can yet actually navigate around room that has never been thus humanoid robots are really quite limited despite their intelligent behaviors their well-known environments factory robots car production over last three decades automobile factories have become dominated by robots typical factory contains hundreds industrial robots working on fully automated production lines with one robot for every ten human workers on automated production line vehicle chassis on conveyor welded glued painted finally assembled at sequence robot stations packaging industrial robots are also used extensively for palletizing packaging manufactured goods for example for rapidly taking drink cartons from end conveyor belt placing them into boxes for loading unloading machining centers electronics mass-produced printed circuit boards pcbs are almost exclusively manufactured by pick-and-place robots typically with scara manipulators which remove tiny electronic components from strips trays place them on pcbs with great accuracy such robots can place hundreds thousands components per hour far out-performing human speed accuracy reliability automated guided vehicles agvs intelligent agv drops-off goods without needing lines beacons workspace mobile robots following markers wires floor using vision lasers are used transport goods around large facilities such warehouses container ports hospitals early agv-style robots limited tasks that could be accurately defined had be performed same way every time very little feedback intelligence was required robots needed only most basic exteroceptors sensors limitations these agvs are that their paths are not easily altered they cannot alter their paths if obstacles block them if one agv breaks down may stop entire operation interim agv technologies developed deploy triangulation from beacons bar code grids for scanning on floor ceiling most factories triangulation systems tend require moderate high maintenance such daily cleaning all beacons bar codes also if tall pallet large vehicle blocks beacons bar code marred agvs may become lost often such agvs are designed be used human-free environments intelligent agvs i-agvs such smartloader speciminder adam tug eskorta mt with motivity are designed for people-friendly workspaces they navigate by recognizing natural features scanners other means sensing environment two three dimensions help eliminate cumulative errors dead-reckoning calculations agvs current position some agvs can create maps their environment using scanning lasers with simultaneous localization mapping slam use those maps navigate real time with other path planning obstacle avoidance algorithms they are able operate complex environments perform non-repetitive non-sequential tasks such transporting photomasks semiconductor lab specimens hospitals goods warehouses for dynamic areas such warehouses full pallets agvs require additional strategies using three-dimensional sensors such time-of-flight stereovision cameras dirty dangerous dull inaccessible tasks there are many jobs which humans would rather leave robots job may be boring such domestic cleaning dangerous such exploring inside volcano other jobs are physically inaccessible such exploring another planet cleaning inside long pipe performing laparoscopic surgery space probes almost every unmanned space probe ever launched was robot some were launched 1960s with very limited abilities but their ability fly land case luna indication their status robot this includes voyager probes galileo probes among others telerobots us marine corps technician prepares use telerobot detonate buried improvised explosive device near camp fallujah iraq teleoperated robots telerobots are devices remotely operated from distance by human operator rather than following predetermined sequence movements but which has semi-autonomous behaviour they are used when human cannot be present on site perform job because dangerous far away inaccessible robot may be another room another country may be on very different scale operator for instance laparoscopic surgery robot allows surgeon work inside human patient on relatively small scale compared open surgery significantly shortening recovery time they can also be used avoid exposing workers hazardous tight spaces such duct cleaning when disabling bomb operator sends small robot disable several authors have been using device called longpen sign books remotely teleoperated robot aircraft like predator unmanned aerial vehicle are increasingly being used by military these pilotless drones can search terrain fire on targets hundreds robots such irobots packbot foster-miller talon are being used iraq afghanistan by us military defuse roadside bombs improvised explosive devices ieds activity known explosive ordnance disposal eod automated fruit harvesting machines robots are used automate picking fruit on orchards at cost lower than that human pickers domestic robots roomba domestic vacuum cleaner robot does single menial job domestic robots are simple robots dedicated single task work home use they are used simple but unwanted jobs such vacuum cleaning floor washing lawn mowing example domestic robot roomba military robots main article military robot military robots include swords robot which currently used ground-based combat can use variety weapons there some discussion giving some degree autonomy battleground situations unmanned combat air vehicles ucavs which are upgraded form uavs can do wide variety missions including combat ucavs are being designed such bae systems mantis which would have ability fly themselves pick their own course target make most decisions on their own bae taranis ucav built by great britain which can fly across continents without pilot has new means avoid detection flight trials are expected begin aaai has studied this topic depth its president has commissioned study look at this issue some have suggested need build friendly ai meaning that advances which are already occurring with ai should also include effort make ai intrinsically friendly humane several such measures reportedly already exist with robot-heavy countries such japan south korea having begun pass regulations requiring robots be equipped with safety systems possibly sets laws akin asimovs three laws robotics official report was issued by japanese governments robot industry policy committee chinese officials researchers have issued report suggesting set ethical rules set new legal guidelines referred robot legal studies some concern has been expressed over possible occurrence robots telling apparent falsehoods mining robots mining robots are designed solve number problems currently facing mining industry including skills shortages improving productivity from declining ore grades achieving environmental targets due hazardous nature mining particular underground mining prevalence autonomous semi-autonomous tele-operated robots has greatly increased recent times number vehicle manufacturers provide autonomous trains trucks loaders that will load material transport on mine site its destination unload without requiring human intervention one worlds largest mining corporations rio tinto has recently expanded its autonomous truck fleet worlds largest consisting autonomous komatsu trucks operating western australia

robots written writer karel čapek was born czechoslovakia czech republic possibly most prolific author twentieth century was isaac asimov 1920–1992 who published over five-hundred books asimov probably best remembered for his science-fiction stories especially those about robots where he placed robots their interaction with society at center many his works asimov carefully considered problem ideal set instructions robots might be given order lower risk humans arrived at his three laws robotics robot may not injure human being through inaction allow human being come harm robot must obey orders given by human beings except where such orders would conflict with first law robot must protect its own existence long such protection does not conflict with first second law these were introduced his short story runaround although foreshadowed few earlier stories later asimov added zeroth law robot may not harm humanity by inaction allow humanity come harm rest laws are modified sequentially acknowledge this according oxford english dictionary first passage asimovs short story liar that mentions first law earliest recorded use word robotics asimov was not initially aware this

germany was digital programmable computer digital computer uses electricity calculating component z3 contained relays create circuits circuits provided binary floating-point nine-instruction computer programming z3 was through specially designed keyboard punched tape electronic numerical integrator computer fall was turing complete general-purpose computer that used vacuum tubes create circuits at its core was series pascalines wired together its units weighed tons occupied square feet consumed $650 per hour 1940s currency electricity when idle had base-10 accumulators programming eniac took up two months three function tables were on wheels needed be rolled fixed function panels function tables were connected function panels using heavy black cables each function table had rotating knobs programming eniac also involved setting some switches debugging program took week eniac featured parallel operations different sets accumulators could simultaneously work on different algorithms used punched card machines for input output was controlled with clock signal ran for eight years calculating hydrogen bomb parameters predicting weather patterns producing firing tables aim artillery guns manchester small-scale experimental machine june was stored-program computer programming transitioned away from moving cables setting dials instead computer program was stored memory numbers only three bits memory were available store each instruction so was limited eight instructions switches were available for programming later computers switches for manual input on data general nova manufactured mid 1970s computers manufactured until 1970s had front-panel switches for programming computer program was written on paper for reference instruction was represented by configuration on/off settings after setting configuration execute button was pressed this process was then repeated computer programs also were manually input via paper tape punched cards after medium was loaded starting address was set via switches execute button pressed burroughs b5000 was built specifically be programmed algol language hardware featured circuits ease compile phase ibm system/360 was line six computers each having same instruction set architecture model was smallest least expensive customers could upgrade retain same application software each system/360 model featured multiprogramming

article programming language computer program written imperative programming style computer programs can be categorized by programming language paradigm used produce them two main paradigms are imperative declarative imperative languages imperative programming languages specify sequential algorithm using declarations expressions statements declaration couples variable name datatype – for example var x integer expression yields value – for example + yields statement might assign expression variable use value variable alter programs control flow – for example x = + if x = then dosomething one criticism imperative languages side effect assignment statement on class variables called non-local variables declarative languages declarative programming languages describe what computation should be performed not how compute declarative programs omit control flow are considered sets instructions two broad categories declarative languages are functional languages logical languages principle behind functional languages like haskell not allow side effects which makes easier reason about programs like mathematical functions principle behind logical languages like prolog define problem be solved – goal – leave detailed solution prolog system itself goal defined by providing list subgoals then each subgoal defined by further providing list its subgoals etc if path subgoals fails find solution then that subgoal backtracked another path systematically attempted compilation interpretation computer program form human-readable computer programming language called source code source code may be converted into executable image by compiler executed immediately with aid interpreter compilers are used translate source code from programming language into either object code machine code object code needs further processing become machine code machine code consists central processing units native instructions ready for execution compiled computer programs are commonly referred executables binary images simply binaries – reference binary file format used store executable code interpreters are used execute source code from programming language immediately without intermediate file interpreter decodes each statement performs its behavior one advantage interpreters that they have ability generate interactive session programmer presented with prompt individual lines code are typed performed immediately main disadvantage interpreters computer programs run slower than when compiled interpreting code slower because interpreter must decode each statement then perform however software development may be faster using interpreter because testing immediate when compiling step omitted another disadvantage interpreters interpreter must be present on executing computer by contrast compiled computer programs need no compiler present during execution just time compilers pre-compile computer programs ahead time interpret them later for example java computer programs are pre-compiled into file containing bytecode bytecode then executed by interpreter called virtual machine either compiled interpreted programs might be executed batch process without human interaction batch programming languages are called scripting languages one common scripting language unix shell its executing environment called command-line interface no properties programming language require be exclusively compiled exclusively interpreted categorization usually reflects most popular method language execution for example basic thought interpreted language c compiled language despite existence basic compilers c interpreters storage execution 1950s computer programs were stored on perforated paper tape typically computer programs are stored non-volatile memory until requested either directly indirectly be executed by computer user upon such request program loaded into random-access memory by computer program called operating system where can be accessed directly by central processor central processor then executes runs program instruction by instruction until termination program execution called process termination either by normal self-termination by error – software hardware error simultaneous execution see also process computing multiprocessing many operating systems support multitasking which enables many computer programs appear run simultaneously on one computer operating systems may run multiple programs through process scheduling – software mechanism switch cpu among processes often so users can interact with each program while runs within hardware modern day multiprocessor computers computers with multicore processors may run multiple programs multiple lines same computer program may be simultaneously executed using threads multithreading processors are optimized execute multiple threads efficiently self-modifying programs main article self-modifying code computer program execution normally treated being different from data program operates on however some cases this distinction blurred when computer program modifies itself modified computer program subsequently executed part same program

'abstraction principle computer programming from wikipedia free encyclopedia   redirected from abstraction principle programming jump navigation search software engineering programming language theory abstraction principle principle abstraction basic dictum that aims reduce duplication information program usually with emphasis on code duplication whenever practical by making use abstractions provided by programming language software libraries principle sometimes stated recommendation programmer but sometimes stated requirement programming language assuming self-understood why abstractions are desirable use origins principle are uncertain has been reinvented number times sometimes under different name with slight variations when read recommendation programmer abstraction principle can be generalized dont repeat yourself principle which recommends avoiding duplication information general also avoiding duplication human effort involved software development process contents principle history variations implications generalizations hardware programming interfaces references principle recommendation programmer its formulation by benjamin c pierce types programming languages abstraction principle reads emphasis original “ each significant piece functionality program should be implemented just one place source code where similar functions are carried out by distinct pieces code generally beneficial combine them into one by abstracting out varying parts ” requirement programming language its formulation by david schmidt structure typed programming languages abstraction principle reads “ phrases any semantically meaningful syntactic class may be named ” history variations under this very name abstraction principle appears into long list books here we give necessarily incomplete list together with formulation if succinct alfred john cole ronald morrison introduction programming with s-algol when applied language design define all semantically meaningful syntactic categories language allow abstraction over them bruce j maclennan principles programming languages design evaluation implementation avoid requiring something be stated more than once factor out recurring pattern jon pearce programming meta-programming scheme structure function should be independent principle plays central role design patterns object-oriented programming although most writings on that topic do not give name principle influential book by gang four states focus here encapsulating concept that varies theme many design patterns this statement has been rephrased by other authors find what varies encapsulate this century principle has been reinvented extreme programming under slogan once only once definition this principle was rather succinct its first appearance no duplicate code has later been elaborated applicable other issues software development automate every process thats worth automating if you find yourself performing task many times script implications abstraction principle often stated context some mechanism intended facilitate abstraction basic mechanism control abstraction function subroutine data abstractions include various forms type polymorphism more elaborate mechanisms that may combine data control abstractions include abstract data types including classes polytypism etc quest for richer abstractions that allow less duplication complex scenarios one driving forces programming language research design inexperienced programmers may be tempted introduce too much abstraction their program—abstraction that wont be used more than once complementary principle that emphasize this issue you aint gonna need more generally kiss principle since code usually subject revisions following abstraction principle may entail refactoring code effort rewriting piece code generically needs be amortized against estimated future benefits abstraction rule thumb governing this was devised by martin fowler popularized rule three states that if piece code copied more than twice ie would end up having three more copies then needs be abstracted out generalizations dont repeat yourself dry principle generalization developed context multi-tier architectures where related code by necessity duplicated some extent across tiers usually different languages practical terms recommendation here rely on automated tools like code generators data transformations avoid repetition hardware programming interfaces addition optimizing code hierarchical/recursive meaning abstraction level programming also refers interfaces between hardware communication layers also called abstraction levels abstraction layers this case level abstraction often synonymous with interface for example examining shellcode interface between higher lower level languages level abstraction changes from operating system commands for example c register circuit level calls commands for example assembly binary case that example boundary interface

systems sharing many similar titles these games were either mostly original clones arcade games text adventures notable example this was so-called bsd games collection interactive fiction titles free software open source methodologies which spawned development operating system general also spawned creation various early free games popular early titles included nethack netrek xbill xevil xbattle xconq xpilot operating system itself grew expanded amount free open source games also increased scale complexity beginning linux gaming platform for commercial video games widely credited have begun when dave d taylor ported game doom linux well many other systems during his spare from there he would also help found development studio crack dot com which released video game abuse with games linux port even being published by linux vendor red hat id software original developers doom also continued release their products for linux their game quake was ported linux once again by dave d taylor working his free time later id products continued be ported by david kirsch timothee besset respectively practice that continued until studios acquisition by zenimax media dux software contracted don hopkins port simcity linux other early commercial linux games included hopkins fbi adventure game released by mp entertainment inner worlds which was released for mostly developed on linux two programmers from origin ported ultima online linux former loki software employee ryan c gordon on november new software firm called loki software was founded by scott draeker former lawyer who became interested porting games linux after being introduced system through his work software licensing attorney loki although commercial failure credited with birth modern linux game industry loki developed several free software tools such loki installer also known loki setup supported development simple directmedia layer well starting openal audio library project these are still often credited being cornerstones linux game development they were also responsible for bringing nineteen high-profile games platform before its closure lokis initial success also attracted other firms invest linux gaming market such tribsoft hyperion entertainment macmillan digital publishing usa titan computer xatrix entertainment philos laboratories vicarious visions during this time michael simms founded tux games one first online linux game retailers - we can observe that several well-known indie game companies eg cipsoft chronic logic illwinter game design introversion software s2 games started publish games for linux they are exceptions who successfully have ported sold games linux for such long period time after lokis closure linux game market experienced some changes although some new firms such linux game publishing runesoft would largely continue role standard porting house focus began change with linux game proponents encouraging game developers port their game products themselves through individual contractors influential this was ryan c gordon former loki employee who would over next decade port several game titles multiple platforms including linux around this time many companies starting with id software also began release legacy source code leading proliferation source ports older games linux other systems this also helped expand already existing free open source gaming scene especially with regards creation free first person shooters sales breakdown across systems first humble indie bundle by number purchasers top dollar value payments bottom linux gaming market also started experience some growth towards end decade with rise independent video game development with many indie developers favouring support for multiple platforms humble indie bundle initiatives helped formally demonstrate this trend with linux users representing sizable population their purchase base well consistently being most financially generous terms actual money spent release linux version desura digital distribution platform with primary focus on small independent developers was also heralded by several commentators important step greater acknowledgement linux gaming platform small indie game company entourev llc published voltley linux which first commercial exclusive game for this operating system same year lgp released shadowgrounds which was first commercial game for

based on linux kernel specifically designed for sole purpose gaming examples are steamos which operating system for steam machines computers video game consoles built from components found classical home computer embedded operating systems like tizen pandora handheld game consoles like gp2x neo geo x nvidia shield runs android operating system which based on modified linux kernel open source design linux software platform allows operating system be compatible with various computer instruction sets many peripherals such game controllers head-mounted displays example oculus rift which upcoming virtual reality head-mounted display supports linux gaming platform performance tests by phoronix showed real-world performance games on linux with proprietary nvidia amd drivers were mostly comparable results on windows phoronix found similar results though ars technica described 20% performance drop with linux drivers mostly software engineers programmers who further compare performance these proprietary drivers with performance available free open-source graphics device drivers intel known for distributing their graphics drivers only free open-source software for all operating systems they support compared amd apus intel dedicates much less die-surface gpu software architecture operating system based on linux kernel customized specifically for gaming could adopt vanilla linux kernel with only little changes or—like android operating system—be based on relative extensively modified linux kernel could adopt gnu c library bionic something like entire middleware parts could very well be closed-source proprietary software same true for video games there are free open-source video games available for linux operating system well proprietary ones linux kernel subsystems already mainlined available linux kernel are most probably performant enough so not impede gaming experience any way however additional software available such eg brain fuck scheduler

list game engines list game engine recreations distinction between game engine other related software game engine software ie some algorithms solely responsible for game mechanics thus there are completely different game engines for first-person shooters strategy video games etc besides game mechanics we also need software do calculations regarding graphics audio video physics vegetation input-handling you name computer games are considered be among most complex software there graphics for fps eg game mechanics calculates with vector data polygon mesh data this data needs be transformed into picture that can be sent computer monitor this called rendering well known rendering techniques used computer games are rasterisation real-time ray tracing software doing rendering called rendering engine rendering software completely distinct form game engine augments game engine but since almost any computer games are played via monitor rendering engine obligate since can be much more difficult program efficient rendering engine that some game engine instead pairing game engines with rendering engines done other way around audio audio effect other techniques require calculations well software doing such calculations could be called audio engine eg fmod software doing this soundrenderer well but not for computer games other software augmenting game engine most common term game engine middleware physics engine potential augmentation that can be incorporated by game engine well-known one havok various eg speedtree middleware solely concerned with trees euphoria middleware solely concerned with human body mechanics game editor software create game levels other game elements can be distinct such eg gtkradiant heavily interwoven with game engine software such cryengine that can be licensed much more than just game engine rather software suite that includes most above-mentioned software more when licensed by some 3rd party code for game engine

ralph baers initial design had called for huge row switches that would allow players turn on off certain components console odyssey lacked cpu create slightly different games like tennis volleyball hockey chase magnavox replaced switch design with separate cartridges for each game although baer had sketched up ideas for cartridges that could include new components for new games carts released by magnavox all served same function switches allowed players choose from odysseys built-in games odyssey initially sold about units making moderately successful was not until ataris arcade game pong

which kept sales low prevented from expanding outside its niche market into serious competition with nintendo sega aes did however amass dedicated cult following allowing see new releases into 2000s fourth generation graphics chips allowed these consoles reproduce art styles that were becoming popular arcades on home computers these games often featured lavish background scenery huge characters broader color pallettes increased emphasis on dithering texture games written specifically for nes like megaman shatterhand super mario bros were able work cleverly within its limitations ports increasingly detailed arcade home computer games came up with various solutions for example when capcom released strider arcade they created entirely separate strider game for nes that only incorporated themes characters from arcade nintendo finally brought their super famicom market brought united states super nes snes year later its release marginalized turbografx neo geo but came late enough for sega sell several million consoles north america gain strong foothold same year snes was released sega released sonic hedgehog which spiked genesis sales similar space invaders on atari also by first fully licensed nfl football game was released nfl sports talk football 93 which was available only on genesis this impact on genesis sales overall interest realistic sports games would start trend licensed sports games being viewed necessary for success console us while nintendo enjoyed dominance japan sega europe competition between two was particularly fierce close north america ultimately snes outsold genesis but only after sega discontinued genesis focus on next generation consoles one trait that remains peculiar fourth generation huge number exclusive games both sega nintendo were very successful their consoles developed massive libraries games both consoles had be programmed assembly get most out them game optimized for genesis could take advantage its faster cpu sound chip game optimized for snes could take advantage its graphics its flexible clean sound chip some game series like castlevania saw separate system exclusive releases rather than attempt port one game disparate platforms when compact disc cd technology became available midway through fourth generation each company attempted integrate into their existing consoles different ways nec sega released cd add-ons their consoles form turbografx-cd sega cd but both were only moderately successful nec also released turboduo which combined turbografx-16 its turbografx-cd add-on along with ram bios upgrade from super system card into one unit snk released third version neogeo neo geo cd allowing company release its games on cheaper medium than aess expensive cartridges but reached market after nintendo sega had already sold tens millions consoles each nintendo partnered with sony work on cd add-on for snes but deal fell apart when they realized how much control sony wanted sony would

expensive than snes genesis combined atari cancelled their line home computers their atari portfolio stacy laptop their handheld atari lynx when they released jaguar was all nothing gamble that ran company into ground jaguar had three processors no c libraries help developers cope with atari was ineffective at courting third parties many their first party games were poorly received while games like tempest rayman alien vs predator showed what console was capable vast majority releases underwhelmed many jaguars games used mainly slowest but most familiar consoles processors resulting titles that could easily have been released on snes genesis compete with emerging next gen consoles nintendo released donkey kong country which could display wide range tones something common fifth-generation games by limiting number hues onscreen star fox which used extra chip inside cartridge display polygon graphics sega followed suit releasing vectorman virtua racing latter which used

computer graphics company at that time john warnock was developing interpreter for large three-dimensional graphics database new york harbor warnock conceived design system language process graphics concurrently researchers at xerox parc had developed first laser printer had recognized need for standard means defining page images 1975-76 bob sproull william newman developed press format which was eventually used xerox star system drive laser printers but press data format rather than language lacked flexibility parc mounted interpress effort create successor evans & sutherland asked warnock move from san francisco bay area their main headquarters utah but he was not interested moving he then joined xerox parc work with martin newell they rewrote design system create j & m for john martin which was used for vlsi design investigation type graphics printing this work later evolved expanded into interpress language warnock left with chuck geschke founded adobe systems december they together with doug brotz ed taft bill paxton created simpler language similar interpress called postscript which went on market at about this time they were visited by steve jobs who urged them adapt postscript be used language for driving laser printers march apple laserwriter was first printer ship with postscript sparking desktop publishing dtp revolution mid-1980s combination technical merits widespread availability made postscript language choice for graphical output for printing applications for time interpreter sometimes referred rip for raster image processor for postscript language was common component laser printers into 1990s however cost implementation was high computers output raw ps code that would be interpreted by printer into raster image at printers natural resolution this required high performance microprocessors ample memory laserwriter used mhz motorola making faster than any macintosh computers which attached when laser printer engines themselves cost over thousand dollars added cost ps was marginal but printer mechanisms fell price cost implementing ps became too great fraction overall printer cost addition with desktop computers becoming more powerful no longer made sense offload rasterisation work onto resource-constrained printer by few lower-end printer models came with support for postscript largely due growing competition from much cheaper non-postscript ink jet printers new software-based methods render postscript images on computer making them suitable for any printer pdf descendant postscript provides one such method has largely replaced postscript de facto standard for electronic document distribution on high-end printers postscript processors remain common their use can dramatically reduce cpu work involved printing documents transferring work rendering postscript images from computer printer postscript level first version postscript language was released market term level was added when level was introduced postscript level postscript level was introduced included several improvements improved speed reliability support for in-rip separations image decompression for example jpeg images could be rendered by postscript program support for composite fonts form mechanism for caching reusable content postscript postscript adobe dropped level terminology favor simple versioning came at end along with many new dictionary-based versions older operators introduced better color handling new filters which allow in-program compression/decompression program chunking advanced error-handling postscript was significant terms replacing existing proprietary color electronic prepress systems then widely used for magazine production through introduction smooth shading operations with up shades grey rather than available postscript level well devicen color space that allowed addition additional ink colors called spot colors into composite color pages use printing before postscript prior introduction postscript printers were designed print character output given text—typically ascii—as input there were number technologies for this task but most shared property that glyphs were physically difficult change they were stamped onto typewriter keys bands metal optical plates this changed some degree with increasing popularity dot matrix printers characters on these systems were drawn series dots defined by font table inside printer they grew sophistication dot matrix printers started including several built-in fonts from which user could select some models allowed users upload their own custom glyphs into printer dot matrix printers also introduced ability print raster graphics graphics were interpreted by computer sent series dots printer using series escape sequences these printer control languages varied from printer printer requiring program authors create numerous drivers vector graphics printing was left special-purpose devices called plotters almost all plotters did share common command language hpgl but were limited use for anything other than printing graphics addition they tended be expensive slow thus rare postscript printing laser printers combine best features both printers plotters like plotters laser printers offer high quality line art like dot-matrix printers they are able generate pages text raster graphics unlike either printers plotters however laser printer makes possible position high-quality graphics text on same page postscript made possible fully exploit these characteristics by offering single control language that could be used on any brand printer postscript went beyond typical printer control language was complete programming language its own many applications can transform document into postscript program whose execution will result original document this program can be sent interpreter printer which results printed document one inside another application which will display document on-screen since document-program same regardless its destination called device-independent postscript noteworthy for implementing on-the fly rasterization everything even text specified terms straight lines cubic bézier curves previously found only cad applications which allows arbitrary scaling rotating other transformations when postscript program interpreted interpreter converts these instructions into dots needed form output for this reason postscript interpreters are occasionally called postscript raster image processors rips font handling main article postscript fonts almost complex postscript itself its handling fonts font system uses ps graphics primitives draw glyphs line art which can then be rendered at any resolution number typographic issues had be considered with this approach one issue that fonts do not actually scale linearly at small sizes features glyphs will become proportionally too large small they start look wrong postscript avoided this problem with inclusion font hinting which additional information provided horizontal vertical bands help identify features each letter that are important for rasterizer maintain result was significantly better-looking fonts even at low resolution had formerly been believed that hand-tuned bitmap fonts were required for this task at time technology for including these hints fonts was carefully guarded hinted fonts were compressed encrypted into what adobe called type font also known postscript type font ps1 t1 adobe type type was effectively simplification ps system store outline information only opposed being complete language pdf similar this regard adobe would then sell licenses type technology those wanting add hints their own fonts those who did not license technology were left with type font also known postscript type font ps3 t3 type fonts allowed for all sophistication postscript language but without standardized approach hinting type font format was designed be used with compact font format cff charstrings was implemented reduce overall font file size cff/type2 format later became basis for handling postscript outlines opentype fonts cid-keyed font format was also designed solve problems ocf/type fonts for addressing complex asian-language cjk encoding very large character set issues cid-keyed font format can be used with type font format for standard cid-keyed fonts type for cid-keyed opentype fonts compete with adobes system apple designed their own system truetype around immediately following announcement truetype adobe published specification for type font format retail tools such altsys fontographer acquired by macromedia january owned by fontlab since may added ability create type fonts since then many free type fonts have been released for instance fonts used with tex typesetting system are available this format early 1990s there were several other systems for storing outline-based fonts developed by bitstream metafont for instance but none included general-purpose printing solution they were therefore not widely used late 1990s adobe joined microsoft developing opentype essentially functional superset type truetype formats when printed postscript output device unneeded parts opentype font are omitted what sent device by driver same would be for truetype type font depending on which kind outlines were present opentype font other implementations 1980s adobe drew most its revenue from licensing fees for their implementation postscript for printers known raster image processor rip number new risc-based platforms became available mid-1980s some found adobes support new machines be lacking this issues cost led third-party implementations postscript becoming common particularly low-cost printers where licensing fee was sticking point high-end typesetting equipment where quest for speed demanded support for new platforms faster than adobe could provide at one point microsoft licensed apple postscript-compatible interpreter had bought called trueimage apple licensing microsoft its new font format truetype apple ended up reaching accord with adobe licensed genuine postscript for its printers but truetype became standard outline font technology for both windows macintosh today third-party postscript-compatible interpreters are widely used printers multifunction peripherals mfps for example csr plcs ips ps3 interpreter formerly known phoenixpage standard many printers mfps including those developed by hewlett-packard sold under laserjet color laserjet lines other third-party postscript solutions used by print mfp manufacturers include jaws harlequin rip both by global graphics free software version with several other applications ghostscript several compatible interpreters are listed on undocumented printing wiki some basic inexpensive laser printers do not support postscript instead coming with drivers that simply rasterize platforms native graphics formats rather than converting them postscript first when postscript support needed for such printer ghostscript can be used there are also number commercial postscript interpreters such teletype cos t-script use display system main articles display postscript news postscript became commercially successful due introduction graphical user interface allowing designers directly lay out pages for eventual output on laser printers however guis own graphics systems were generally much less sophisticated than postscript apples quickdraw for instance supported only basic lines arcs not complex b-splines advanced region filling options postscript order take full advantage postscript printing applications on computers had re-implement those features using host platforms own graphics system this led numerous issues where on-screen layout would not exactly match printed output due differences implementation these features computer power grew became possible host ps system computer rather than printer this led natural evolution ps from printing system one that could also be used hosts own graphics language there were numerous advantages this approach not only did help eliminate possibility different output on screen printer but also provided powerful graphics system for computer allowed printers be dumb at time when cost laser engines was falling production setting using postscript display system meant that host computer could render low-resolution screen higher resolution printer simply send ps code smart printer for offboard printing however postscript was written with printing mind had numerous features that made unsuitable for direct use interactive display system particular ps was based on idea collecting up ps commands until showpage command was seen at which point all commands read up that point were interpreted output interactive system this was clearly not appropriate nor did ps have any sort interactivity built for example supporting hit detection for mouse interactivity obviously did not apply when ps was being used on printer when steve jobs left apple started next he pitched adobe on idea using ps display system for his new workstation computers result was display postscript dps dps added basic functionality improve performance by changing many string lookups into bit integers adding support for direct output with every command adding functions allow gui inspect diagram additionally set bindings was provided allow ps code be called directly from c programming language next used these bindings their nextstep system provide object oriented graphics system although dps was written conjunction with next adobe sold commercially was common feature most unix workstations 1990s sun microsystems took another approach creating news instead dpss concept allowing ps interact with c programs news instead extended ps into language suitable for running entire gui computer sun added number new commands for timers mouse control interrupts other systems needed for interactivity added data structures language elements allow be completely object oriented internally complete gui three fact were written news provided for time on their workstations however ongoing efforts standardize x11 system led its introduction widespread use on sun systems news never became widely used language postscript turing-complete programming language belonging concatenative group typically postscript programs are not produced by humans but by other programs however possible write computer programs postscript just like any other programming language postscript interpreted stack-based language similar forth but with strong dynamic typing data structures inspired by those found lisp scoped memory since language level garbage collection language syntax uses reverse polish notation which makes order operations unambiguous but reading program requires some practice because one has keep layout stack mind most operators what other languages term functions take their arguments from stack place their results onto stack literals for example numbers have effect placing copy themselves on stack sophisticated data structures can be built on array dictionary types but cannot be declared type system which sees them all only arrays dictionaries so any further typing discipline be applied such user-defined types left code that implements them character % used introduce comments postscript programs general convention every postscript program should start with characters %ps interpreter directive so that all devices will properly interpret postscript hello world hello world program customary way show

postscript uses point its unit length however unlike some other versions point postscript uses exactly points inch thus point = 1/72 inch = 127/360 mm = micrometer for example order draw vertical line cm length sufficient type moveto lineto stroke more readably idiomatically one might use following equivalent which demonstrates simple procedure definition use mathematical operators mul div /mm {360

'action-adventure game from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search action-adventure redirects here for other uses see action-adventure disambiguation action-adventure game video game genre that combines core elements action game adventure game with decline adventure game genre from mainstream popularity use term hybrid term action-adventure has been more liberal not uncommon for gamers apply term adventure action adventure describe genre fiction which game belongs not gameplay itself action-adventure hybrid genre thus definition very inclusive leading be perhaps broadest genre video games can include many games which might better be categorized under narrow genres typically pure adventure games have situational problems for player solve with very little no action if there action generally confined isolated minigames pure action games have gameplay based on real-time interactions that challenge reflexes therefore action-adventure games engage both reflexes problem-solving both violent non-violent situations contents definition subgenres gameplay history references external links definition action-adventure game can be defined game with mix elements from action game adventure game especially crucial elements like puzzles action-adventures require many same physical skills action games but also offer storyline numerous characters inventory system dialogue other features adventure games they are faster-paced than pure adventure games because they include both physical conceptual challenges action-adventure games normally include combination complex story elements which are displayed for players using audio video story heavily reliant upon player characters movement which triggers story events thus affects flow game some examples action-adventure games include legend zelda god war tomb raider series exactly when game stops being adventure game becomes action game matter interpretation there are quite few disagreements community media over what actually constitutes action-adventure game one definition term action adventure may be an action/adventure game game that has enough action not be called adventure game but not enough action be called action game some cases action game with puzzles will be classified action-adventure game but if these puzzles are quite simple they might be classified action game others see action games pure genre while action-adventure action game that includes situational problem-solving adventure gamers may also be purists rejecting any game that makes use physical challenges time pressure regardless action-adventure label prominent articles over internet media term action-adventure usually substituted for particular subgenre due its wide scope subgenres although action-adventure games are diverse difficult classify there are some distinct subgenres popular subgenres include first-person action-adventure which make use first-person shooter gameplay forgoing constant action favor important adventure game elements such environmental problem-solving complex plot these are sometimes called real-time adventure games rtas for short notable examples this include metroid prime half-life dishonored far cry third-person action-adventure which gameplay third-person notable examples include games like tomb raider series legend zelda series rune severance blade darkness grand theft auto series hitman series uncharted series isometric platform games which feature freely explorable environments with three-dimensional gameplay two-dimensional graphics using isometric projection sandbox/open world action-adventure which focus on nonlinear gameplay open world notable examples include grand theft auto series legend zelda series assassins creed series platform-adventure games which emphasize both exploration puzzle solving but also feature traditional platform game conventions examples games this type are tomb raider series banjo-kazooie series super mario series metroid castlevania games term metroidvania derived from these latter two used describe games this genre that generally are based on two-dimensional platformers stealth games which emphasize avoiding detection by enemies rather than engaging them direct combat leading greater emphasis on exploration puzzle-solving than other types action games notable examples include metal gear series assassins creed series hitman series survival horror games which emphasize inventory management making sure player has enough ammunition recovery items survive horror setting survival-horror thematic genre with diverse gameplay however so not all survival horror games share these features resident evil silent hill franchises popularized this subgenre stand date most popular franchises its kind gameplay see also common objectives gameplay adventure games defining elements action games action-adventure games are faster paced than pure adventure games include physical well conceptual challenges where story enacted rather than narrated while motion-based often reflexive actions are required gameplay still follows number adventure game genre tropes gathering items exploration interaction with ones environment often including overworld connecting areas importance puzzle-solving while controls are arcade-style character movement few action commands there ultimate goal beyond high score most action-adventure games player controls single avatar protagonist this type game often quite similar role-playing video games they are distinct from graphic adventures which sometimes have free-moving central characters but also wider variety commands fewer no action game elements are distinct too from text adventures characterized by many different commands introduced by user via complex text parser no free-moving character while they share general gameplay dynamics action-adventures vary widely design their viewpoints including birds eye side scrolling first-person third-person over-the-shoulder even 3/4 isometric view many action-adventure games simulate conversation through conversation tree when player encounters non-player character they are allowed select choice what say npc gives scripted response player game offers player several new ways respond due action-adventure subgenres broad inclusive nature causes some players having difficulty finishing particular game compensate for this lack players ability companies have devised ways give player help such helpful clues allowing them skip puzzles outright history legend zelda seminal title that established action-adventure game genre history action-adventure genre began with text-based colossal cave adventure which was first adventure game ever created first written for pdp-10 was later ported countless

first action-adventure game adventure considered first known game this genre later silas warner arrived at muse software where he developed castle wolfenstein action-adventure game that would inspire id software create first-person shooter wolfenstein according roe r adams who worked on wizardry series rpgs early action-adventures were basically arcade games done fantasy setting pointing castlevania trojan wizards & warriors examples action-adventure later became established genre with shigeru miyamotos legend zelda which became success due how combined elements from different genres create compelling hybrid including exploration transport puzzles adventure-style inventory puzzles action component monetary system simplified rpg-style level building without experience points game was also early example open world nonlinear gameplay introduced innovations like saving on battery backup became one most influential games 8-bit era inspiring action-adventures like metroid rpgs like final fantasy zelda has since remained most prolific action-adventure game series through present day games like xanadu metroid vampire killer combined action-adventure exploration with side-scrolling platformer format creating metroidvania platform-adventure subgenre similarly games like castle wolfenstein metal gear combined action-adventure exploration with stealth mechanics laying foundations for stealth game subgenre which would later be popularized by metal gear solid tenchu stealth assassins thief dark project cinematic platformer prince persia featured action-adventure elements inspiring games such another world flashback alone dark featured use graphics which would later be popularized by resident evil tomb raider resident evil particular created survival horror subgenre

mac gaming websites references external links early game development on mac prior release first macintosh computer number marketing executives at apple were concerned that including game finished operating system would aggravate impression that graphical user interface made mac toy-like more critically limited amount ram original macintosh meant that fitting game into operating system would be very difficult eventually andy hertzfeld created desk accessory called puzzle that occupied only bytes memory this was deemed small enough be safely included operating system shipped with mac when released with puzzle—the first computer game specifically for mouse—the macintosh became first computer with game its rom would remain part mac os for next ten years until being replaced with jigsaw jigsaw puzzle game included part system during development mac chess game similar archon based on alice wonderland was shown development team game was written by steve capps for apple lisa computer but could be easily ported macintosh completed game was shown at macs launch released few months later under title through looking glass but apple failed put much marketing effort into ensuring its success game was not top seller by mid-1980s most computer companies avoided term home computer because its association with image compute wrote low-powered low-end machine primarily suited for playing games apples john sculley for example denied that his company sold home computers rather he said apple sold computers for use home company reportedly refused support joysticks on its low-cost macintosh lc iisi computers prevent customers from considering them game machines game development on macintosh nonetheless continued with titles such dark castle microsoft flight simulator simcity though mostly games for mac were developed alongside those for other platforms notable exceptions were myst developed on mac part using hypercard only afterwards ported windows pathways into darkness which spawned halo franchise journeyman project lunicus spaceship warlock jump raven apple was first manufacturer ship cd-rom drives standard equipment on macintosh iivx later centris models many early cd-rom based games were initially developed for mac especially era often confusing multimedia pc standards pippin apple pippin also known bandai pippin was multimedia player based on power mac that ran cut-down version mac os designed among other things play games sold between japan united states was not commercial success with fewer than units sold fewer than thousand games software applications supported attempts by apple promote gaming on mac ] this section needs expansion you can help by adding october apple has at times attempted market platform for gaming april steve jobs gave interview with uk-based arcade magazine promote powerpc g3-based computers apple were selling with then new ati rage graphics cards describing how apple was trying build best gaming platform world so developers are attracted write for trying leapfrog pc industry original mac games although currently most big-name mac games are ports this has not always been case perhaps most popular game which was originally developed for macintosh was 1993s myst by cyan was ported windows next year cyans later games were released simultaneously for both platforms with exception uru ages beyond myst which was windows-only until mac-compatible re-release currently beta by gametap with help transgamings cider virtualization software from 1980s atmospheric air hockey game shufflepuck café brøderbund graphical adventure game shadowgate mindscape were among most prominent games developed first for macintosh later ported for other platforms another popular mac game was marathon series first-person shooters these games were released wake popular doom which defined first-person shooter genre but contained many innovations new uncommon similar games from time such weapons with two functions ability for player look fire up down swim through liquids fight alongside allied characters wield two weapons at once bungie studios would port second series marathon durandal windows platform where met with some success they also ported their post-marathon games myth oni windows at macworld conference & expo new york city bungie showed demonstration new game entitled halo be released for mac next year before this happened bungie was purchased by microsoft halo was released exclusively for xbox video game console macintosh windows versions game did not arrive until late almost four half years after its original announcement at macworld today there are many companies both large small creating original games for macintosh however following trend industry these tend be lower-budget casual games with simple graphics that are easy pick up play short bursts opposed high-budget hardcore games that are more graphically intensive require large investments time play master windows games particular problem for companies attempting port windows games macintosh licensing middleware middleware off-the-shelf software that handles certain aspects games making easier for game creators develop games return for paying middleware developer licensing fee however since license mac porting house obtains from game creator does not normally include rights use middleware well mac porting company must either license middleware separately attempt find alternative examples middleware include havok physics engine gamespy internet-based multiplayer gaming client because smaller market companies developing games for mac usually seek lower licensing fee than windows developers when middleware company refuses such terms porting that particular windows game mac may be uneconomical engineering viable alternative within available budget impossible result some popular games which use havok engine have not yet been ported macintosh other cases workaround solutions may be found case gamespy one workaround limit mac gamers play against each other but not with users playing windows version however some cases gamespy has been reverse-engineered implemented into mac game so that able network seamlessly with windows version game in-house porting only few companies have developed continue develop games for both mac windows platforms notable examples these are transgaming aspyr big fish games blizzard entertainment brøderbund linden lab microsoft many ways this ideal situation those creating mac version have direct access original programmers case any questions concerns arise about source code also increases likelihood that mac windows versions game will launch concurrently nearly so many obstacles inherent third-party porting process are avoided another benefit in-house porting if carried out simultaneously with game development that company can release hybrid discs easing game distribution largely eliminating shelf space problem among mac versions popular windows games that were developed in-house are diablo microsoft flight simulator second life stubbs zombie call duty world warcraft third-party porting most high-budget games that come macintosh are originally created for microsoft windows ported mac operating system by one relatively small number porting houses among most notable these are aspyr feral interactive macsoft games red marble games coladia games macplay critical factor for financial viability these porting houses number copies game sold successful title may sell only units licensing deal between original game developer porting house may be flat one-time payment percentage profits from mac games sale both while this license gives porting house access artwork source code does not normally cover middleware such third-party game engines modifying source code macintosh platform may be difficult code for games often highly optimized for windows operating system intel-compatible processors latter presented obstacle previous years when macintosh platform utilized powerpc processors due difference endianness between two types processors but todays macintosh computers employ intel processors well obstacle has been mitigated somewhat one example common work for porting house converting graphics instructions targeted for microsofts directx graphics library instructions for opengl library directx favored by most windows game developers but incompatible with macintosh due time involved licensing porting product macintosh versions games ported by third-party companies are usually released anywhere from three months more than year after their windows-based counterparts for example windows version civilization iv was released on october but mac gamers had wait eight months until june for release mac version boot camp april apple released beta version boot camp product which allows intel-based macintoshes boot directly into windows xp windows vista reaction from mac game developers software journalists introduction boot camp has been mixed ranging from assuming mac will be dead platform for game development cautious optimism that mac owners will continue play games within mac os rather than by rebooting windows number mac ports windows games released was never likely be very great despite steadily increasing number mac users emulation virtualization over years there have been number emulators for macintosh that allowed run ms-dos windows software most notably realpc softpc softwindows virtual pc although more less adequate for business applications these programs have tended deliver poor performance when used for running games particularly where high-end technologies like directx were involved since introduction intel processor into macintosh platform windows virtualization software such parallels desktop for mac vmware fusion have been seen more promising solutions for running windows software on mac operating systemin some ways they are better solutions than boot camp they do not require rebooting machine vmware fusions public beta supports hardware-accelerated graphics which utilize directx library up version parallels desktop for mac version has announced support for gpu acceleration allowing mac users play windows-based games wine-based projects main article wine software transgaming technologies has developed product called cider which popular method among publishers port games mac ciders engine enables publishers developers target mac os x shares much same core technology transgamings linux portability engine cedega public reception games ported with cider mixed due inconsistency performance between titles because this ciderized games are neither seen work cross-platform development nor native optimized ports both cider cedega are based on wine electronic arts announced their return mac publishing various titles simultaneously on both windows mac using cider open source wine-based project called wineskin allows anyone attempt port games mac os x since uses all open source components open source itself its technology very similar what transgaming does with cider but free use anyone wineskin creates self-contained clickable mac applications out installation wrappers that can be made from this are often shared with friends others legal versions games can then be installed easily into shared wrapper then final result works like normal mac app wineskin mainly only used hobbyist porting not professional porting but some professional game companies have used major releases since end there paulthetallcom app called porting kit which automatically creates ready-to-use wineskin wrappers for some specific games codeweavers crossover products use compatibility layer translate windows

over games how well each individual game works with wine can be found at appdbwinehqorg games are listed platinum which means they work out-of-the-box while more are listed gold meaning they require some tweaking installation run flawlessly shelf space problem one problem afflicting both porting houses original mac game developers that shelf space which refers amount space retail store allocates stocking mac games due its small market share macintosh software whole receives very little if any shelf space most major computer retail stores within that space retailers are usually reluctant stock relatively inexpensive games which may may not sell well opposed high-cost top-selling products such microsoft office adobe photoshop because this most smaller mac game companies release their products using shareware business model either exclusively addition more traditional retail boxed version all porting houses larger game companies have stuck traditional model but recent rise digital download model may lead some companies eventually releasing games paid downloads model similar valve corporations steam service mmorpgs are largely immune shelf space problem ncsofts lineage was one

downloads major published mac titles linux gaming free software games more recent years mac gaming has become more intertwined with gaming on another unix-like platform linux gaming this trend began when linux began gain mac-style porting houses first which was loki software later linux game publishing linux porters born from this new industry have also been commonly hired mac porters often releasing games for both systems this includes game porters like ryan c gordon who brought unreal tournament linux mac companies like hyperion entertainment who primarily supports amigaos well mac linux runesoft german publisher that has done ports for linux game publishing recently mac-focused porter aspyr has also started releasing titles for linux starting with civilization v feral interactive has also released xcom enemy unknown middle-earth shadow mordor for linux indie game development has also been conducive intertwining with developers like wolfire games lugaru overgrowth frictional games penumbra amnesia boy world goo sillysoft games lux basilisk games eschalon supporting both platforms with native versions id software was also pioneer both mac linux gaming with ports their games once done by timothee besset illwinter game design also notable for supporting both platforms open source video games have also proved modestly popular on mac although due free software nature system development free software titles mostly begins on linux afterwards major games are typically ported mac microsoft windows mac has less mainstream games than windows result free games have had more impact on platform notable free games popular on mac include battle for wesnoth openarena bzflag lincity more valve corporation interview with valve corporations half-life counter-strike team fortress source engine gabe newell included question why his company was keeping their games gaming technology strictly windows project newell answered “ we tried have conversation with apple for several years they never seemed well we have this pattern with apple where we meet with them people there go wow gaming incredibly important we should do something with gaming then well say ok here are three things you could do make that better then they say ok then we never see them again then year later new group people show up who apparently have no idea that last group people were there never follow through on anything so they seem think that they want do gaming but theres never any follow through on any things they say theyre going do that makes hard be excited about doing games for their platforms ” on february after release public open beta version steam member on steam forums found new files pertaining mac os x program files beta after several days speculation by gaming

mathematics computer science algorithm i/ˈælɡərɪðəm/ al-gə-ri-dhəm self-contained step-by-step set operations be performed algorithms perform calculation data processing and/or automated reasoning tasks english word algorithm comes from medieval latin word algorism greek word arithmos ἀριθμός word algorism therefore derived word algorithm comes from al-khwārizmī persian خوارزمی‎‎ c 780–850 persian mathematician astronomer geographer scholar english adopted french term but wasnt until late 19th century that algorithm took on meaning that has modern english english was first used about then by chaucer another early use word from manual titled carmen de algorismo composed by alexandre de villedieu begins thus haec algorismus ars praesens dicitur qua / talibus indorum fruimur bis

starting from initial state initial input perhaps empty instructions describe computation that when executed proceeds through finite number well-defined successive states eventually producing output terminating at final ending state transition from one state next not necessarily deterministic some algorithms known randomized algorithms incorporate random input concept algorithm has existed for centuries however partial formalization what would become modern algorithm began with attempts solve entscheidungsproblem decision problem posed by david hilbert subsequent formalizations were framed

algorithm characterizations informal definition could be set rules that precisely defines sequence operations which would include all computer programs including programs that do not perform numeric calculations generally program only algorithm if stops eventually prototypical example algorithm euclids algorithm determine maximum common divisor two integers example there are others described by flow chart above example later section boolos & jeffrey offer informal meaning word following quotation no human being can write fast enough long enough small enough† †smaller smaller without limit youd be trying write on molecules on atoms on electrons list all members enumerably infinite set by writing out their names one after another some notation but humans can do something equally useful case certain enumerably infinite sets they can give explicit instructions for determining nth member set for arbitrary finite n such instructions are be given quite explicitly form which they could be followed by computing machine by human who capable carrying out only very elementary operations on symbols enumerably infinite set one whose elements can be put into one-to-one correspondence with integers thus boolos jeffrey are saying that algorithm implies instructions for process that creates output integers from arbitrary input integer integers that theory can be arbitrarily large thus algorithm can be algebraic equation such y = m + n – two arbitrary input variables m n that produce output y but various authors attempts define notion indicate that word implies much more than this something on order for addition example precise instructions language understood by computer for fast efficient good process that specifies moves computer machine human equipped with necessary internally contained information capabilities find decode then process arbitrary input integers/symbols m n symbols + = effectively produce reasonable time output-integer y at specified place specified format concept algorithm also used define notion decidability that notion central for explaining how formal systems come into being starting from small set axioms rules logic time that algorithm requires complete cannot be measured not apparently related with our customary physical dimension from such uncertainties that characterize ongoing work stems unavailability definition algorithm that suits both concrete some sense abstract usage term formalization algorithms are essential way computers process data many computer programs contain algorithms that detail specific instructions computer should perform specific order carry out specified task such calculating employees paychecks printing students report cards thus algorithm can be considered be any sequence operations that can be simulated by turing-complete system authors who assert this thesis include minsky savage gurevich minsky but we will also maintain with turing that any procedure which could naturally be called effective can fact be realized by simple machine although this may seem extreme arguments its favor are hard refute gurevich turings informal argument favor his thesis justifies stronger thesis every algorithm can be simulated by turing machine according savage algorithm computational process defined by turing machine typically when algorithm associated with processing information data are read from input source written output device and/or stored for further processing stored data are regarded part internal state entity performing algorithm practice state stored one more data structures for some such computational process algorithm must be rigorously defined specified way applies all possible circumstances that could arise that any conditional steps must be systematically dealt with case-by-case criteria for each case must be clear computable because algorithm precise list precise steps order computation always crucial functioning algorithm instructions are usually assumed be listed explicitly are described starting from top going down bottom idea that described more formally by flow control so far this discussion formalization algorithm has assumed premises imperative programming this most common conception attempts describe task discrete mechanical means unique this conception formalized algorithms assignment operation setting value variable derives from intuition memory scratchpad there example below such assignment for some alternate conceptions what constitutes algorithm see functional programming logic programming expressing algorithms algorithms can be expressed many kinds notation including natural languages pseudocode flowcharts drakon-charts programming languages control tables processed by interpreters natural language expressions algorithms tend be verbose ambiguous are rarely used for complex technical algorithms pseudocode flowcharts drakon-charts control tables are structured ways express algorithms that avoid many ambiguities common natural language statements programming languages are primarily intended for expressing algorithms form that can be executed by computer but are often used way define document algorithms there wide variety representations possible one can express given turing machine program sequence machine tables see more at finite state machine state transition table control table flowcharts drakon-charts see more at state diagram form rudimentary machine code assembly code called sets quadruples see more at turing machine representations algorithms can be classed into three accepted levels turing machine description high-level description prose describe algorithm ignoring implementation details at this level we do not need mention how machine manages its tape head implementation description prose used define way turing machine uses its head way that stores data on its tape at this level we do not give details states transition function formal description most detailed lowest level gives turing machines state table for example simple algorithm add m+n described all three levels see algorithmexamples implementation logical nand algorithm implemented electronically chip most algorithms are intended be implemented computer programs however algorithms are also implemented by other means such biological neural network for example human brain implementing arithmetic insect looking for food electrical circuit mechanical device computer algorithms flowchart examples canonical böhm-jacopini structures sequence rectangles descending page

nesting these structures inside assignment-blocks result complex diagrams cf tausworthe computer systems algorithm basically instance logic written software by software developers be effective for intended target computers produce output from given perhaps null input optimal algorithm even running old hardware would produce faster results than non-optimal higher time complexity algorithm for same purpose running more efficient hardware that why algorithms like computer hardware are considered technology elegant compact programs good fast programs notion simplicity elegance appears informally knuth precisely chaitin knuth we want good algorithms some loosely defined aesthetic sense one criterion length time taken perform algorithm other criteria are adaptability algorithm computers its simplicity elegance etc chaitin program elegant by which i mean that its smallest possible program for producing output that does chaitin prefaces his definition with ill show you cant prove that program elegant—such proof would solve halting problem ibid algorithm versus function computable by algorithm for given function multiple algorithms may exist this true even without expanding available instruction set available programmer rogers observes that important distinguish between notion algorithm ie procedure notion function computable by algorithm ie mapping yielded by procedure same function may have several different algorithms unfortunately there may be tradeoff between goodness speed elegance compactness—an elegant program may take more steps complete computation than one less elegant example that uses euclids algorithm appears below computers computors models computation computer human computor restricted type machine discrete deterministic mechanical device that blindly follows its instructions melzaks lambeks primitive models reduced this notion four elements i discrete distinguishable locations ii discrete indistinguishable counters iii agent iv list instructions that are effective relative capability agent minsky describes more congenial variation lambeks abacus model his very simple bases for computability minskys machine proceeds sequentially through its five six depending on how one counts instructions unless either conditional if–then goto unconditional goto changes program flow out sequence besides halt minskys machine includes three assignment replacement substitution operations zero eg contents location replaced by l ← successor eg l ← l+1 decrement eg l ← l − rarely must programmer write code with such limited instruction set but minsky shows do melzak lambek that his machine turing complete with only four general types instructions conditional goto unconditional goto assignment/replacement/substitution halt simulation algorithm computer computor language knuth advises reader that best way learn algorithm try immediately take pen paper work through example but what about simulation execution real thing programmer must translate algorithm into language that simulator/computer/computor can effectively execute stone gives example this when computing roots quadratic equation computor must know how take square root if they dont then algorithm be effective must provide set rules for extracting square root this means that programmer must know language that effective relative target computing agent computer/computor but what model should be used for simulation van emde boas observes even if we base complexity theory on abstract instead concrete machines arbitrariness choice model remains at this point that notion simulation enters when speed being measured instruction set matters for example subprogram euclids algorithm compute remainder would execute much faster if programmer had modulus instruction available rather than just subtraction worse just minskys decrement structured programming canonical structures per church–turing thesis any algorithm can be computed by model known be turing complete per minskys demonstrations turing completeness requires only four instruction types—conditional goto unconditional goto assignment halt kemeny kurtz observe that while undisciplined use unconditional gotos conditional if-then gotos can result spaghetti code programmer can write structured programs using only these instructions on other hand also possible not too hard write badly structured programs structured language tausworthe augments three böhm-jacopini canonical structures sequence if-then-else while-do with two more

looking at every number list from this follows simple algorithm which can be stated high-level description english prose high-level description if there are no numbers set then there no highest number assume first number set largest number set for each remaining number set if this number larger than current largest number consider this number be largest number set when there are no numbers left set iterate over consider current largest number be largest number set quasi-formal description written prose but much closer high-level language computer program following more formal coding algorithm pseudocode pidgin code algorithm largestnumber input list numbers l output largest number list l if lsize = return null largest ← l for each item l do if item > largest then largest ← item return largest ← shorthand for changes for instance largest ← item means that value largest changes value item return terminates algorithm outputs value that follows euclid’s algorithm further information euclids algorithm example-diagram euclids algorithm from tl heath with more detail added euclid does not go beyond third measuring gives no numerical examples nicomachus gives example i subtract less from greater left then again i subtract from this same for this possible left i subtract this from left from which i again subtract for this possible left but cannot be subtracted from heath comments that last phrase curious but meaning obvious enough also meaning phrase about ending at one same numberheath euclid’s algorithm compute greatest common divisor gcd two numbers appears proposition ii book vii elementary number theory his elements euclid poses problem thus given two numbers not prime one another find their greatest common measure he defines number multitude composed units counting number positive integer not including zero measure place shorter measuring length s successively q times along longer length l until remaining portion r less than shorter length s modern words remainder r = l − q×s q being quotient remainder r modulus integer-fractional part left over after division for euclid’s method succeed starting lengths must satisfy two requirements i lengths must not be zero ii subtraction must be “proper” ie test must guarantee that smaller two numbers subtracted from larger alternately two can be equal so their subtraction yields zero euclids original proof adds third requirement two lengths must not be prime one another euclid stipulated this so that he could construct reductio ad absurdum proof that two numbers common measure fact greatest while nicomachus algorithm same euclids when numbers are prime one another yields number for their common measure so be precise following really nicomachus algorithm graphical expression euclids algorithm find greatest common divisor for = 650×2 + = 299×2 + = 52×5 + = 39×1 + = 13×3 + computer language for euclids algorithm only few instruction types are required execute euclids algorithm—some logical tests conditional goto unconditional goto assignment replacement subtraction location symbolized by upper case letters eg s etc varying quantity number location written lower case letters usually associated with locations name for example location l at start might contain number l = inelegant program for euclids algorithm inelegant translation knuths version algorithm with subtraction-based remainder-loop replacing his use division modulus instruction derived from knuth 19732–4 depending on two numbers inelegant may compute gcd fewer steps than elegant following algorithm framed knuths four-step version euclids nicomachus but rather than using division find remainder uses successive subtractions shorter length s from remaining length r until r less than s high-level description shown boldface adapted from knuth 19732–4 input input l s r ← l e0 if r > s then contents l larger number so skip over exchange-steps goto step else swap contents r s l ← r this first step redundant but useful for later discussion r ← s s ← l e1 until remaining length r r less than shorter length s s repeatedly subtract measuring number s s from remaining length r r if s > r then done measuring so goto else measure again r ← r − s goto e2 either i last measure was exact remainder r zero program can halt ii algorithm must continue last measure left remainder r less than measuring number s if r = then done so goto step else continue step e3 nut euclids algorithm use remainder r measure what was previously smaller number s l serves temporary location l ← r r ← s s ← l goto output print s done halt end stop elegant program for euclids algorithm following version euclids algorithm requires only six core instructions do what thirteen are required do by inelegant worse inelegant requires more types instructions flowchart elegant can be found at top this article unstructured basic language steps are numbered instruction let = assignment instruction symbolized by ← rem euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor print type two integers greater than input ab if b=0 then goto if > b then goto let b=b-a goto let a=a-b goto print end following version can be used with object oriented languages // euclids algorithm for greatest common divisor integer euclidalgorithm int int b{ a=mathabsa b=mathabsb while b=0{ if a>b a=a-b else b=b-a } return } how elegant works place outer euclid loop elegant shifts back forth between two co-loops > b loop that computes ← − b b ≤ loop that computes b ← b − this works because when at last minuend m less than equal subtrahend s difference = minuend − subtrahend minuend can become s new measuring length subtrahend can become new r length be measured other words sense subtraction reverses testing euclid algorithms does algorithm do what its author wants do few test cases usually suffice confirm core functionality one source uses knuth suggested another interesting case two relatively prime numbers but exceptional cases must be identified tested will inelegant perform properly when r > s s > r r = s ditto for elegant b > > b = b yes all what happens when one number zero both numbers are zero inelegant computes forever all cases elegant computes forever when = what happens if negative numbers are entered fractional numbers if input numbers ie domain function computed by algorithm/program include only positive integers including zero then failures at zero indicate that algorithm program that instantiates partial function rather than total function notable failure due exceptions ariane flight rocket failure june proof program correctness by use mathematical induction knuth demonstrates application mathematical induction extended version euclids algorithm he proposes general method applicable proving validity any algorithm tausworthe proposes that measure complexity program be length its correctness proof measuring improving euclid algorithms elegance compactness versus goodness speed with only six core instructions elegant clear winner compared inelegant at thirteen instructions however inelegant faster arrives at halt fewer steps algorithm analysis indicates why this case elegant does two conditional tests every subtraction loop whereas inelegant only does one algorithm usually requires many loop-throughs on average much time wasted doing b = test that needed only after remainder computed can algorithms be improved once programmer judges program fit effective—that computes function intended by its author—then question becomes can be improved compactness inelegant can be improved by elimination five steps but chaitin proved that compacting algorithm cannot be automated by generalized algorithm rather can only be done heuristically ie by exhaustive search examples be found at busy beaver trial error cleverness insight application inductive reasoning etc observe that steps are repeated steps comparison with elegant provides hint that these steps together with steps can be eliminated this reduces number core instructions from thirteen eight which makes more elegant than elegant at nine steps speed elegant can be improved by moving b=0 test outside two subtraction loops this change calls for addition three instructions b = = goto now elegant computes example-numbers faster whether this always case for any given b r s would require detailed analysis algorithmic analysis main article analysis algorithms frequently important know how much particular resource such time storage theoretically required for given algorithm methods have been developed for analysis algorithms obtain such quantitative answers estimates for example sorting algorithm above has time requirement on using big o notation with n length list at all times algorithm only needs remember two values largest number found so far its current position input list therefore said have space requirement o1 if space required store input numbers not counted on if counted different algorithms may complete same task with different set instructions less more time space effort than others for example binary search algorithm with cost olog n outperforms sequential search cost on when used for table lookups on sorted lists arrays formal versus empirical main articles empirical algorithmics profiling computer programming program optimization analysis study algorithms discipline computer science often practiced abstractly without use specific programming language implementation this sense algorithm analysis resembles other mathematical disciplines that focuses on underlying properties algorithm not on specifics any particular implementation usually pseudocode used for analysis simplest most general representation however ultimately most algorithms are usually implemented on particular hardware / software platforms their algorithmic efficiency eventually put test using real code for solution one off problem efficiency particular algorithm may not have significant consequences unless n extremely large but for algorithms designed for fast interactive commercial long life scientific usage may be critical scaling from small n large n frequently exposes inefficient algorithms that are otherwise benign empirical testing useful because may uncover unexpected interactions that affect performance benchmarks may be used compare before/after potential improvements algorithm after program optimization execution efficiency main article algorithmic efficiency illustrate potential improvements possible even well established algorithms recent significant innovation relating fft algorithms used heavily field image processing can decrease processing time up times for applications like medical imaging general speed improvements depend on special properties problem which are very common practical applications speedups this magnitude enable computing devices that make extensive use image processing like digital cameras medical equipment consume less power classification there are various ways classify algorithms each with its own merits by implementation one way classify algorithms by implementation means recursion recursive algorithm one that invokes makes reference itself repeatedly until certain condition also known termination condition matches which method common functional programming iterative algorithms use repetitive constructs like loops sometimes additional data structures like stacks solve given problems some problems are naturally suited for one implementation other for example towers hanoi well understood using recursive implementation every recursive version has equivalent but possibly more less complex iterative version vice versa logical algorithm may be viewed controlled logical deduction this notion may be expressed algorithm = logic + control logic component expresses axioms that may be used computation control component determines way which deduction applied axioms this basis for logic programming paradigm pure logic programming languages control component fixed algorithms are specified by supplying only logic component appeal this approach elegant semantics change axioms has well-defined change algorithm serial parallel distributed algorithms are usually discussed with assumption that computers execute one instruction algorithm at time those computers are sometimes called serial computers algorithm designed for such environment called serial algorithm opposed parallel algorithms distributed algorithms parallel algorithms take advantage computer architectures where several processors can work on problem at same time whereas distributed algorithms utilize multiple machines connected with network parallel distributed algorithms divide problem into more symmetrical asymmetrical subproblems collect results back together resource consumption such algorithms not only processor cycles on each processor but also communication overhead between processors some sorting algorithms can be parallelized efficiently but their communication overhead expensive iterative algorithms are generally parallelizable some problems have no parallel algorithms are called inherently serial problems deterministic non-deterministic deterministic algorithms solve problem with exact decision at every step algorithm whereas non-deterministic algorithms solve problems via guessing although typical guesses are made more accurate through use heuristics exact approximate while many algorithms reach exact solution approximation algorithms seek approximation that close true solution approximation may use either deterministic random strategy such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems quantum algorithm they run on realistic model quantum computation term usually used for those algorithms which seem inherently quantum use some essential feature quantum computation such quantum superposition quantum entanglement by design paradigm another way classifying algorithms by their design methodology paradigm there certain number paradigms each different from other furthermore each these categories include many different types algorithms some common paradigms are brute-force exhaustive search this naive method trying every possible solution see which best divide conquer divide conquer algorithm repeatedly reduces instance problem one more smaller instances same problem usually recursively until instances are small enough solve easily one such example divide conquer merge sorting sorting can be done on each segment data after dividing data into segments sorting entire data can be obtained conquer phase by merging segments simpler variant divide conquer called decrease conquer algorithm that solves identical subproblem uses solution this subproblem solve bigger problem divide conquer divides problem into multiple subproblems so conquer stage more complex than decrease conquer algorithms example decrease conquer algorithm binary search algorithm search enumeration many problems such playing chess can be modeled problems on graphs graph exploration algorithm specifies rules for moving around graph useful for such problems this category also includes search algorithms branch bound enumeration backtracking randomized algorithm such algorithms make some choices randomly pseudo-randomly they can be very useful finding approximate solutions for problems where finding exact solutions can be impractical see heuristic method below for some these problems known that fastest approximations must involve some randomness whether randomized algorithms with polynomial time complexity can be fastest algorithms for some problems open question known p versus np problem there are two large classes such algorithms monte carlo algorithms return correct answer with high-probability eg rp subclass these that run polynomial time las vegas algorithms always return correct answer but their running time only probabilistically bound eg zpp reduction complexity this technique involves solving difficult problem by transforming into better known problem for which we have hopefully asymptotically optimal algorithms goal find reducing algorithm whose complexity not dominated by resulting reduced algorithms for example one selection algorithm for finding median unsorted list involves first sorting list expensive portion then pulling out middle element sorted list cheap portion this technique also known transform conquer optimization problems for optimization problems there more specific classification algorithms algorithm for such problems may fall into one more general categories described above well into one following linear programming when searching for optimal solutions linear function bound linear equality inequality constraints constraints problem can be used directly producing optimal solutions there are algorithms that can solve any problem this category such popular simplex algorithm problems that can be solved with linear programming include maximum flow problem for directed graphs if problem additionally requires that one more unknowns must be integer then classified integer programming linear programming algorithm can solve such problem if can be proved that all restrictions for integer values are superficial ie solutions satisfy these restrictions anyway general case specialized algorithm algorithm that finds approximate solutions used depending on difficulty problem dynamic programming when problem shows optimal substructures — meaning optimal solution problem can be constructed from optimal solutions subproblems — overlapping subproblems meaning same subproblems are used solve many different problem instances quicker approach called dynamic programming avoids recomputing solutions that have already been computed for example floyd–warshall algorithm shortest path goal from vertex weighted graph can be found by using shortest path goal from all adjacent vertices dynamic programming memoization go together main difference between dynamic programming divide conquer that subproblems are more less independent divide conquer whereas subproblems overlap dynamic programming difference between dynamic programming straightforward recursion caching memoization recursive calls when subproblems are independent there no repetition memoization does not help hence dynamic programming not solution for all complex problems by using memoization maintaining table subproblems already solved dynamic programming reduces exponential nature many problems polynomial complexity greedy method greedy algorithm similar dynamic programming algorithm that works by examining substructures this case not problem but given solution such algorithms start with some solution which may be given have been constructed some way improve by making small modifications for some problems they can find optimal solution while for others they stop at local optima that at solutions that cannot be improved by algorithm but are not optimum most popular use greedy algorithms for finding minimal spanning tree where finding optimal solution possible with this method huffman tree kruskal prim sollin are greedy algorithms that can solve this optimization problem heuristic method optimization problems heuristic algorithms can be used find solution close optimal solution cases where finding optimal solution impractical these algorithms work by getting closer closer optimal solution they progress principle if run for infinite amount time they will find optimal solution their merit that they can find solution very close optimal solution relatively short time such algorithms include local search tabu search simulated annealing genetic algorithms some them like simulated annealing are non-deterministic algorithms while others like tabu search are deterministic when bound on error non-optimal solution known algorithm further categorized approximation algorithm by field study see also list algorithms every field science has its own problems needs efficient algorithms related problems one field are often studied together some example classes are search algorithms sorting algorithms merge algorithms numerical algorithms graph algorithms string algorithms computational geometric algorithms combinatorial algorithms medical algorithms machine learning cryptography data compression algorithms parsing techniques fields tend overlap with each other algorithm advances one field may improve those other sometimes completely unrelated fields for example dynamic programming was invented for optimization resource consumption industry but now used solving broad range problems many fields by complexity see also complexity class parameterized complexity algorithms can be

building structure elements computer programs—that expresses logic computation without describing its control flow many languages that apply this style attempt minimize eliminate side effects by describing what program must accomplish terms problem domain rather than describe how accomplish sequence programming language primitives how being left up languages implementation this contrast with imperative programming which implements algorithms explicit steps declarative programming often considers programs theories formal logic computations deductions that logic space declarative programming may greatly simplify writing parallel programs common declarative languages include those database query languages eg sql xquery regular expressions logic programming functional programming configuration management systems contents definition subparadigms o constraint programming o domain-specific languages o functional programming o hybrid languages o logic programming o modeling see also references external links definition declarative programming often defined any style programming that not imperative number other common definitions exist that attempt give term definition other than simply contrasting with imperative programming for example program that describes what computation should be performed not how compute any programming language that lacks side effects more specifically referentially transparent language with clear correspondence mathematical logic these definitions overlap substantially declarative programming contrasts with imperative procedural programming declarative programming non-imperative style programming which programs describe their desired results without explicitly listing commands steps that must be performed functional logical programming languages are characterized by declarative programming style logical programming languages programs consist logical statements program executes by searching for proofs statements pure functional language such haskell all functions are without side effects state changes are only represented functions that transform state which explicitly represented first class object program although pure functional languages are non-imperative they often provide facility for describing effect function series steps other functional languages such lisp ocaml erlang support mixture procedural functional programming some logical programming languages such prolog database query languages such sql while declarative principle also support procedural style programming subparadigms declarative programming umbrella term that includes number better-known programming paradigms constraint programming constraint programming states relations between variables form constraints that specify properties target solution set constraints solved by giving value each variable so that solution consistent with maximum number constraints constraint programming often complements other paradigms functional logical even imperative programming domain-specific languages well-known examples declarative domain-specific languages dsls include yacc parser generator input language make build specification language puppets configuration management language regular expressions subset sql select queries for example dsls have advantage being useful while not necessarily needing be turing-complete which makes easier for language be purely declarative many markup languages such html mxml xaml xslt other user-interface markup languages are often declarative html for example only describes what should appear on webpage - specifies neither control flow rendering page nor its possible interactions with user some software systems combine traditional user-interface markup languages such html with declarative markup that defines what but not how back-end server systems should do support declared interface such systems typically using domain-specific xml namespace may include abstractions sql database syntax parameterised calls web services using representational state transfer rest soap functional programming functional programming particular purely functional programming attempts minimize eliminate side effects therefore considered declarative most functional languages such scheme clojure erlang haskell ocaml standard ml unlambda do permit side effects practice using non-pure functions interact with outside world when needed while functional languages typically do appear specify how compiler for purely functional programming language free extensively rewrite operational behavior function so long same result returned for same inputs this can be used for example make function compute its result parallel perform substantial optimizations such deforestation that compiler may not be able safely apply language with side effects hybrid languages see also multi-paradigm programming language makefiles for example specify dependencies declarative fashion but include imperative list actions take well similarly yacc specifies context free grammar declaratively but includes code snippets from host language which usually imperative such c logic programming logic programming languages such prolog state query relations specifics how these queries are answered up implementation its theorem prover but typically take form some sort unification like functional programming many logic programming languages permit side effects result are not strictly declarative modeling main article mathematical model models mathematical representations physical systems may be implemented computer code that declarative code contains number equations not imperative assignments that describe declare behavioral relationships when model

video games considered best list video game soundtracks considered best development game ai game design interaction design game programming level design video game art video game design video game graphics video game music v t e this list video games that have consistently been ranked among best by video game journalists critics publications largely based on top / top type lists that list best games ever publications view sometimes restricted time period generation systems while any single publications list reflects its own taste when lists are taken aggregate handful notable games have achieved something approaching critical consensus by multiple appearances such lists often ranking highly when they do appear contents methods used list other criteria see also references methods used number sources taken from across publications from present were used compile list games which consistently showed up multiple lists are featured below some lists are outdated that same publication later published another best-of list there were two notable exceptions critic best lists games are credited for having gamerankings metacritic scores greater about games several large reader-submitted polls are used general contemporary reviews do not necessarily reflect long-term consensus hence only single source credit for high gamerankings/metacritic reviews open player-submitted polls while obviously measuring important facet games reputation tend be easy rig otherwise influence hence primary usage critic lists because most sources are from english-language press this list reflects preferences english-speaking world primarily north america lesser extent western europe not those other video-game-playing areas such japan south korea only non-english sources used are japanese reader polls from famitsu dengeki german reader poll from m games very recent games are not usually represented either another issue vote split many publications either implicitly explicitly choose single game from set closely related games stand-in for whole group sometimes this easily combined with various versions tetris street fighter ii other cases this impossible resulting series that would have made list had all versions been combined but not separately one example tony hawks pro skater series – which first second third games all received nods from variety critic best-of lists yet no individual game achieved enough consensus be listed here this list mostly includes games since third generation gaming onwards along with some prior arcade games late 70s early 80s minimum

structured programming modular programming general have been promoted techniques improve maintainability overall quality imperative programs concepts behind object-oriented programming attempt extend this approach procedural programming could be considered step towards declarative programming programmer can often tell simply by looking at names arguments return types procedures related comments what particular procedure supposed do without necessarily looking at details how achieves its result at same time complete program still imperative since fixes statements be executed their order execution large extent rationale foundations imperative programming hardware implementation almost all computers imperative nearly all computer hardware designed execute machine code which native computer written imperative style from this low-level perspective program state defined by contents memory statements are instructions native machine language computer higher-level imperative languages use variables more complex statements but still follow same paradigm recipes process checklists while not computer programs are also familiar concepts that are similar style imperative programming each step instruction physical world holds state since basic ideas imperative programming are both conceptually familiar directly embodied hardware most computer languages are imperative style assignment statements imperative paradigm perform operation on information located memory store results memory for later use high-level imperative languages addition permit evaluation complex expressions which may consist combination arithmetic operations function evaluations assignment resulting value memory looping statements while loops do while loops for loops allow sequence statements be executed multiple times loops can either execute statements they contain predefined number times they can execute them repeatedly until some condition changes conditional branching statements allow sequence statements be executed only if some condition met otherwise statements are skipped execution sequence continues from statement following them unconditional branching statements allow execution sequence be transferred another part program these include jump called goto many languages switch subprogram subroutine procedure call which usually returns next statement after call early development high-level programming languages introduction block enabled construction programs which group statements declarations could be treated if they were one statement this alongside introduction subroutines enabled complex structures be expressed by hierarchical decomposition into simpler procedural structures many imperative programming languages such fortran basic c are abstractions assembly language history imperative object-oriented languages earliest imperative languages were machine languages original computers these languages instructions were very simple which made hardware implementation easier but hindered creation complex programs fortran developed by john backus at international business machines ibm starting was first major programming language remove obstacles presented by machine code creation complex programs fortran was compiled language that allowed named variables complex expressions subprograms many other features now common imperative languages next two decades saw development many other major high-level imperative programming languages late 1950s 1960s algol was developed order allow mathematical algorithms be more easily expressed even served operating systems target language for some computers mumps carried imperative paradigm logical extreme by not having any statements at all relying purely on commands even extent making if else commands independent each other connected only by intrinsic variable named $test cobol basic were both attempts make programming syntax look more like english 1970s pascal was developed

'data structure from wikipedia free encyclopedia jump navigation search hash table not be confused with data type computer science data structure particular way organizing data computer so that can be used efficiently data structures can implement one more particular abstract data types adt which specify operations that can be performed on data structure computational complexity those operations comparison data structure concrete implementation specification provided by adt different kinds data structures are suited different kinds applications some are highly specialized specific tasks for example relational databases commonly use b-tree indexes for data retrieval while compiler implementations usually use hash tables look up identifiers data structures provide means manage large amounts data efficiently for uses such large databases internet indexing services usually efficient data structures are key designing efficient algorithms some formal design methods programming languages emphasize data structures rather than algorithms key organizing factor software design data structures can be used organize storage retrieval information stored both main memory secondary memory contents overview examples language support see also references further reading external links overview data structures are generally based on ability computer fetch store data at any place its memory specified by pointer—a bit string representing memory address that can be itself stored memory manipulated by program thus array record data structures are based on computing addresses data items with arithmetic operations while linked data structures are based on storing addresses data items within structure itself many data structures use both principles sometimes combined non-trivial ways xor linking implementation data structure usually requires writing set procedures that create manipulate instances that structure efficiency data structure cannot be analyzed separately from those operations this observation motivates theoretical concept abstract data type data structure that defined indirectly by operations that may be performed on mathematical properties those operations including their space time cost examples main article list data structures there are numerous types data structures generally built upon simpler primitive data types array number elements specific order typically all same type elements are accessed using integer index specify which element required depending on language individual elements may either all be forced be same type may be almost any type typical implementations allocate contiguous memory words for elements arrays but this not always necessity arrays may be fixed-length resizable linked list also just called list linear collection data elements any type called nodes where each node has itself value points next node linked list principal advantage linked list over array that values can always be efficiently inserted removed without relocating rest list certain other operations such random access certain element are however slower on lists than on arrays record also called tuple struct aggregate data structure record value that contains other values typically fixed number sequence typically indexed by names elements records are usually called fields members union data structure that specifies which number permitted primitive types may be stored its instances eg float long integer contrast with record which could be defined contain float integer whereas union there only one value at time enough space allocated contain widest member datatype tagged union also called variant variant record discriminated union disjoint union contains additional field indicating its current type for enhanced type safety class data structure that contains data fields like record well various methods which operate on contents record context object-oriented programming records are known plain old data structures distinguish them from classes language support most assembly languages some low-level languages such bcpl basic combined programming language lack built-in support for data structures on other hand many high-level programming languages some higher-level assembly languages such masm have special syntax other built-in support for certain data structures such records arrays for example c pascal languages support structs records respectively addition vectors one-dimensional arrays multi-dimensional arrays most programming languages feature some sort library mechanism that allows data structure implementations be reused by different programs modern languages usually come with standard libraries that implement most common data structures examples are c++ standard template library java collections framework microsofts net framework modern languages also generally support modular programming separation between interface library module its implementation some provide opaque data types that allow clients hide implementation details object-oriented programming languages such c++ java smalltalk may use classes for this purpose many known data structures have concurrent versions

language notation for writing programs which are specifications computation algorithm some but not all authors restrict term programming language those languages that can express all possible algorithms traits often considered important for what constitutes programming language include function target computer programming language language used write computer programs which involve computer performing some kind computation algorithm possibly control external devices such printers disk drives robots so on for example postscript programs are frequently created by another program control computer printer display more generally programming language may describe computation on some possibly abstract machine generally accepted that complete specification for programming language includes description possibly idealized machine processor for that language most practical contexts programming language involves computer consequently programming languages are usually defined studied this way programming languages differ from natural languages that natural languages are only used for interaction between people while programming languages also allow humans communicate instructions machines abstractions programming languages usually contain abstractions for defining manipulating data structures controlling flow execution practical necessity that programming language support adequate abstractions expressed by abstraction principle this principle sometimes formulated recommendation programmer make proper use such abstractions expressive power theory computation classifies languages by computations they are capable expressing all turing complete languages can implement same set algorithms ansi/iso sql-92 charity are examples languages that are not turing complete yet often called programming languages markup languages like xml html troff which define structured data are not usually considered programming languages programming languages may however share syntax with markup languages if computational semantics defined xslt for example turing complete xml dialect moreover latex which mostly used for structuring documents also contains turing complete subset term computer language sometimes used interchangeably with programming language however usage both terms varies among authors including exact scope each one usage describes programming languages subset computer languages this vein languages used computing that have different goal than expressing computer programs are generically designated computer languages for instance markup languages are sometimes referred computer languages emphasize that they are not meant be used for programming another usage regards programming languages theoretical constructs for programming abstract machines computer languages subset thereof that runs on physical computers which have finite hardware resources john c reynolds emphasizes that formal specification languages are just much programming languages are languages intended for execution he also argues that textual even graphical input formats that affect behavior computer are programming languages despite fact they are commonly not turing-complete remarks that ignorance programming language concepts reason for many flaws input formats history main article history programming languages early developments earliest computers were often programmed without help programming language by writing programs absolute machine language programs decimal binary form were read from punched cards magnetic tape toggled on switches on front panel computer absolute machine languages were later termed first-generation programming languages 1gl next step was development so-called second-generation programming languages 2gl assembly languages which were still closely tied instruction set architecture specific computer these served make program much more human-readable relieved programmer tedious error-prone address calculations first high-level programming languages third-generation programming languages 3gl were written 1950s early high-level programming language be designed for computer was plankalkül developed for german z3 by konrad zuse between however was not implemented until john mauchlys short code proposed was one first high-level languages ever developed for electronic computer unlike machine code short code statements represented mathematical expressions understandable form however program had be translated into machine code every time ran making process much slower than running equivalent machine code manchester mark ran programs written autocode from at university manchester alick glennie developed autocode early 1950s programming language used compiler automatically convert language into machine code first code compiler was developed for mark computer at university manchester considered be first compiled high-level programming language second autocode was developed for mark by r brooker was called mark autocode brooker also developed autocode for ferranti mercury 1950s conjunction with university manchester version for edsac was devised by d f hartley university cambridge mathematical laboratory known edsac autocode was straight development from mercury autocode adapted for local circumstances was noted for its object code optimisation source-language diagnostics which were advanced for time contemporary but separate thread development atlas autocode was developed for university manchester atlas machine language fortran was invented at ibm by john backus was first widely used high level general purpose programming language have functional implementation opposed just design on paper still popular language for high-performance computing used for programs that benchmark rank worlds fastest supercomputers another early programming language was devised by grace hopper us called flow-matic was developed for univac i at remington rand during period from until hopper found that business data processing customers were uncomfortable with mathematical notation early she her team wrote specification for english programming language implemented prototype flow-matic compiler became publicly available early was substantially complete flow-matic was major influence design cobol since only its direct descendant aimaco were actual use at time refinement increased use high-level languages introduced requirement for low-level programming languages system programming languages these languages varying degrees provide facilities between assembly languages high-level languages can be used perform tasks which require direct access hardware facilities but still provide higher-level control structures error-checking period from 1960s late 1970s brought development major language paradigms now use apl introduced array programming influenced functional programming algol refined both structured procedural programming discipline language specification revised report on algorithmic language algol became model for how later language specifications were written lisp implemented was first dynamically typed functional programming language 1960s simula was first language designed support object-oriented programming mid-1970s smalltalk followed with first purely object-oriented language c was developed between system programming language for unix operating system remains popular prolog designed was first logic programming language ml built polymorphic type system on top lisp pioneering statically typed functional programming languages each these languages spawned descendants most modern programming languages count at least one them their ancestry 1960s 1970s also saw considerable debate over merits structured programming whether programming languages should be designed support edsger dijkstra famous letter published communications acm argued that goto statements should be eliminated from all higher level programming languages consolidation growth selection textbooks that teach programming languages both popular obscure these are only few thousands programming languages dialects that have been designed history 1980s were years relative consolidation c++ combined object-oriented systems programming united states government standardized ada systems programming language derived from pascal intended for use by defense contractors japan elsewhere vast sums were spent investigating so-called fifth generation languages that incorporated logic programming constructs functional languages community moved standardize ml lisp rather than inventing new paradigms all these movements elaborated upon ideas invented previous decades one important trend language design for programming large-scale systems during 1980s was increased focus on use modules large-scale organizational units code modula-2 ada ml all developed notable module systems 1980s which were often wedded generic programming constructs rapid growth internet mid-1990s created opportunities for new languages perl originally unix scripting tool first released became common dynamic websites java came be used for server-side programming bytecode virtual machines became popular again commercial settings with their promise write once run anywhere ucsd pascal had been popular for time early 1980s these developments were not fundamentally novel rather they were refinements many existing languages paradigms although their syntax was often based on c family programming languages programming language evolution continues both industry research current directions include security reliability verification new kinds modularity mixins delegates aspects database integration such microsofts linq fourth-generation programming languages 4gl are computer programming languages which aim provide higher level abstraction internal computer hardware details than 3gls fifth generation programming languages 5gl are programming languages based on solving problems using constraints given program rather than using algorithm written by programmer elements all programming languages have some primitive building blocks for description data processes transformations applied them like addition two numbers selection item from collection these primitives are defined by syntactic semantic rules which describe their structure meaning respectively syntax main article syntax programming languages parse tree python code with inset tokenization syntax highlighting often used aid programmers recognizing elements source code language above python programming languages surface form known its syntax most programming languages are purely textual they use sequences text including words numbers punctuation much like written natural languages on other hand there are some programming languages which are more graphical nature using visual relationships between symbols specify program syntax language describes possible combinations symbols that form syntactically correct program meaning given combination symbols handled by semantics either formal hard-coded reference implementation since most languages are textual this article discusses textual syntax programming language syntax usually defined using combination regular expressions for lexical structure backus–naur form for grammatical structure below simple grammar based on lisp expression = atom | list atom = number | symbol number = + symbol = list =  expression  this grammar specifies following expression either atom list atom either number symbol number unbroken sequence one more decimal digits optionally preceded by plus minus sign symbol letter followed by zero more any characters excluding whitespace list matched pair parentheses with zero more expressions inside following are examples well-formed token sequences this grammar b c232 not all syntactically correct programs are semantically correct many syntactically correct programs are nonetheless ill-formed per languages rules may depending on language specification soundness implementation result error on translation execution some cases such programs may exhibit undefined behavior even when program well-defined within language may still have meaning that not intended by person who wrote using natural language example may not be possible assign meaning grammatically correct sentence sentence may be false colorless green ideas sleep furiously grammatically well-formed but has no generally accepted meaning john married bachelor

trigger error on compilation variable p would not be defined but program would still be syntactically correct since type declarations provide only semantic information grammar needed specify programming language can be classified by its position chomsky hierarchy syntax most programming languages can be specified using type-2 grammar ie they are context-free grammars some languages including perl lisp contain constructs that allow execution during parsing phase languages that have constructs that allow programmer alter behavior parser make syntax analysis undecidable problem generally blur distinction between parsing execution contrast lisps macro system perls begin blocks which may contain general computations c macros are merely string replacements do not require code execution semantics term semantics refers meaning languages opposed their form syntax static semantics static semantics defines restrictions on structure valid texts that are hard impossible express standard syntactic formalisms for compiled languages static semantics essentially include those semantic rules that can be checked at compile time examples include checking that every identifier declared before used languages that require such declarations that labels on arms case statement are distinct many important restrictions this type like checking that identifiers are used appropriate context eg not adding integer function name that subroutine calls have appropriate number type arguments can be enforced by defining them rules logic called type system other forms static analyses like data flow analysis may also be part static semantics newer programming languages like java c have definite assignment analysis form data flow analysis part their static semantics dynamic semantics main article semantics programming languages once data has been specified machine must be instructed perform operations on data for example semantics may define strategy by which expressions are evaluated values manner which control structures conditionally execute statements dynamic semantics also known execution semantics language defines how when various constructs language should produce program behavior there are many ways defining execution semantics natural language often used specify execution semantics languages commonly used practice significant amount academic research went into formal semantics programming languages which allow execution semantics be specified formal manner results from this field research have seen limited application programming language design implementation outside academia type system main articles data type type system type safety type system defines how programming language classifies values expressions into types how can manipulate those types how they interact goal type system verify usually enforce certain level correctness programs written that language by detecting certain incorrect operations any decidable type system involves trade-off while rejects many incorrect programs can also prohibit some correct albeit unusual programs order bypass this downside number languages have type loopholes usually unchecked casts that may be used by programmer explicitly allow normally disallowed operation between different types most typed languages type system used only type check programs but number languages usually functional ones infer types relieving programmer from need write type annotations formal design study type systems known type theory typed versus untyped languages language typed if specification every operation defines types data which operation applicable with implication that not applicable other types for example data represented by this text between quotes string many programming languages dividing number by string has no meaning will be rejected by compilers invalid operation may be detected when program compiled static type checking will be rejected by compiler with compilation error message may be detected when program run dynamic type checking resulting run-time exception many languages allow function called exception handler be written handle this exception for example always return result special case typed languages are single-type languages these are often scripting markup languages such rexx sgml have only one data type—most commonly character strings which are used for both symbolic numeric data contrast untyped language such most assembly languages allows any operation be performed on any data which are generally considered be sequences bits various lengths high-level languages which are untyped include bcpl tcl some varieties forth practice while few languages are considered typed from point view type theory verifying rejecting all operations most modern languages offer degree typing many production languages provide means bypass subvert type system trading type-safety for finer control over programs execution see casting static versus dynamic typing static typing all expressions have their types determined prior when program executed typically at compile-time for example 2+2 are integer expressions they cannot be passed function that expects string stored variable that defined hold dates statically typed languages can be either manifestly typed type-inferred first case programmer must explicitly write types at certain textual positions for example at variable declarations second case compiler infers types expressions declarations based on context most mainstream statically typed languages such c++ c java are manifestly typed complete type inference has traditionally been associated with less mainstream languages such haskell ml however many manifestly typed languages support partial type inference for example java c both infer types certain limited cases additionally some programming languages allow for some types be automatically converted other types for example int can be used where program expects float dynamic typing also called latent typing determines type-safety operations at run time other words types are associated with run-time values rather than textual expressions with type-inferred languages dynamically typed languages do not require programmer write explicit type annotations on expressions among other things this may permit single variable refer values different types at different points program execution however type errors cannot be automatically detected until piece code actually executed potentially making debugging more difficult lisp smalltalk perl python javascript ruby are dynamically typed weak strong typing weak typing allows value one type be treated another for example treating string number this can occasionally be useful but can also allow some kinds program faults go undetected at compile time even at run time strong typing prevents above attempt perform operation on wrong type value raises error strongly typed languages are often termed type-safe safe alternative definition for weakly typed refers languages such perl javascript which permit large number implicit type conversions javascript for example expression x implicitly converts x number this conversion succeeds even if x null undefined array string letters such implicit conversions are often useful but they can mask programming errors strong static are now generally considered orthogonal concepts but usage literature differs some use term strongly typed mean strongly statically typed even more confusingly mean simply statically typed thus c has been called both strongly typed weakly statically typed may seem odd some professional programmers that c could be weakly statically typed however notice that use generic pointer void pointer does allow for casting pointers other pointers without needing do explicit cast this extremely similar somehow casting array bytes any kind datatype c without using explicit cast such int char standard library run-time system main article standard library most programming languages have associated core library sometimes known standard library especially if included part published language standard which conventionally made available by all implementations language core libraries typically include definitions for commonly used algorithms data structures mechanisms for input output line between language its core library differs from language language some cases language designers may treat library separate entity from language however languages core library often treated part language by its users some language specifications even require that this library be made available all implementations indeed some languages are designed so that meanings certain syntactic constructs cannot even be described without referring core library for example java string literal defined instance javalangstring class similarly smalltalk anonymous function expression block constructs instance librarys blockcontext class conversely scheme contains multiple coherent subsets that suffice construct rest language library macros so language designers do not even bother say which portions language must be implemented language constructs which must be implemented parts library design implementation programming languages share properties with natural languages related their purpose vehicles for communication having syntactic form separate from its semantics showing language families related languages branching one from another but artificial constructs they also differ fundamental ways from languages that have evolved through usage significant difference that programming language can be fully described studied its entirety since has precise finite definition by contrast natural languages have changing meanings given by their users different communities while constructed languages are also artificial languages designed from ground up with specific purpose they lack precise complete semantic definition that programming language has many programming languages have been designed from scratch altered meet new needs combined with other languages many have eventually fallen into disuse although there have been attempts design one universal programming language that serves all purposes all them have failed be generally accepted filling this role need for diverse programming languages arises from diversity contexts which languages are used programs range from tiny scripts written by individual hobbyists huge systems written by hundreds programmers programmers range expertise from novices who need simplicity above all else experts who may be comfortable with considerable complexity programs must balance speed size simplicity on systems ranging from microcontrollers supercomputers programs may be written once not change for generations they may undergo continual modification programmers may simply differ their tastes they may be accustomed discussing problems expressing them particular language one common trend development programming languages has been add more ability solve problems using higher level abstraction earliest programming languages were tied very closely underlying hardware computer new programming languages have developed features have been added that let programmers express ideas that are more remote from simple translation into underlying hardware instructions because programmers are less tied complexity computer their programs can do more computing with less effort from programmer this lets them write more functionality per time unit natural language programming has been proposed way eliminate need for specialized language for programming however this goal remains distant its benefits are open debate edsger w dijkstra took position that use formal language essential prevent introduction meaningless constructs dismissed natural language programming foolish alan perlis was similarly dismissive idea hybrid approaches have been taken structured english sql languages designers users must construct number artifacts that govern enable practice programming most important these artifacts are language specification implementation specification main article programming language specification specification programming language artifact that language users implementors can use agree upon whether piece source code valid program that language if so what its behavior shall be programming language specification can take several forms including following explicit definition syntax static semantics execution semantics language while syntax commonly specified using formal grammar semantic definitions may be written natural language eg c language formal semantics eg standard ml scheme specifications description behavior translator for language eg c++ fortran specifications syntax semantics language have be inferred from this description which may be written natural formal language reference model implementation sometimes written language being specified eg prolog ansi rexx syntax semantics language are explicit behavior reference implementation implementation main article programming language implementation implementation programming language provides way write programs that language execute them on one more configurations hardware software there are broadly two approaches programming language implementation compilation interpretation generally possible implement language using either technique output compiler may be executed by hardware program called interpreter some implementations that make use interpreter approach there no distinct boundary between compiling interpreting for instance some implementations basic compile then execute source line at time programs that are executed directly on hardware usually run several orders magnitude faster than those that are interpreted software one technique for improving performance interpreted programs just-in-time compilation here virtual machine just before execution translates blocks bytecode which are going be used machine code for direct execution on hardware proprietary languages this

programming languages more programming languages differ from most other forms human expression that they require greater degree precision completeness when using natural language communicate with other people human authors speakers can be ambiguous make small errors still expect their intent be understood however figuratively speaking computers do exactly what they are told do cannot understand what code programmer intended write combination language definition program programs inputs must fully specify external behavior that occurs when program executed within domain control that program on other hand ideas about algorithm can be communicated humans without precision required for execution by using pseudocode which interleaves natural language with code written programming

primitives compose new programs adapt existing ones new uses changing environment programs for computer might be executed batch process without human interaction user might type commands interactive

means varies by context one language may occupy greater number programmer hours different one have more lines code third may consume most cpu time some languages are very popular for particular kinds applications for example cobol still strong corporate data center often on large mainframes fortran scientific engineering applications ada aerospace transportation military real-time embedded applications c embedded applications operating systems other languages are regularly used write many different kinds applications various methods measuring language popularity each subject different bias over what measured have been proposed counting number job advertisements that mention language number books sold that teach describe language estimates number existing lines code written language – which may underestimate languages not often found public searches counts language references ie name language found using web search engine combining averaging information from various internet sites langpopcom claims that ten most popular programming languages are descending order by overall popularity c java php javascript c++ python shell ruby objective-c c taxonomies for more details on this topic see categorical list programming languages there no overarching classification scheme for programming languages given programming language does not usually have single ancestor language languages commonly arise by combining elements several predecessor languages with new ideas circulation at time ideas that originate one language will diffuse throughout family related languages then leap suddenly across familial gaps appear entirely different family task further complicated by fact that languages can be classified along multiple axes for example java both object-oriented language because encourages object-oriented organization concurrent language because contains built-in constructs for running multiple threads parallel python object-oriented scripting language broad strokes programming languages divide into programming paradigms classification by intended domain use with general-purpose programming languages distinguished from domain-specific programming languages traditionally programming languages have been regarded describing computation terms imperative sentences ie issuing commands these are generally called imperative programming languages great deal research programming languages has been aimed at blurring distinction between program set instructions program assertion about desired answer which main feature declarative programming more refined paradigms include procedural programming object-oriented programming functional programming logic programming some languages are hybrids paradigms multi-paradigmatic assembly language not so much paradigm direct model underlying machine architecture by purpose programming languages might be considered general purpose system programming languages scripting languages domain-specific languages

various electronic magnetic optical mechanical changes surface layer one more rotating disks disk drive device implementing such storage mechanism notable types are hard disk drive hdd containing non-removable disk floppy disk drive fdd its removable floppy disk various optical disc drives associated optical disc media spelling disk disc are used interchangeably except where trademarks preclude one usage eg compact disc logo choice particular form frequently historical ibms usage disk form beginning with ibm disk storage unit six hard disk drives three floppy disk drives cd-rom optical disc drive contents background access methods rotation speed track layout interfaces basic terminology see also references background audio information was originally recorded by analog methods see sound recording reproduction similarly first video disc used analog recording method music industry analog recording has been mostly replaced by digital optical technology where data are recorded digital format with optical information first commercial digital disk storage device was ibm which shipped part ibm ramac computing system random-access low-density storage disks was developed complement already used sequential-access high-density storage provided by tape drives using magnetic tape vigorous innovation disk storage technology coupled with less vigorous innovation tape storage has reduced difference acquisition cost per terabyte between disk storage tape storage however total cost ownership data on disk including power management remains larger than that tape disk storage now used both computer storage consumer electronic storage eg audio cds video discs standard dvd blu-ray access methods digital disk drives are block storage devices each disk divided into logical blocks collection sectors blocks are addressed using their logical block addresses lba read from writing disk happens at granularity blocks originally disk capacity was quite low has been improved one several ways improvements mechanical design manufacture allowed smaller more precise heads meaning that more tracks could be stored on each disks advancements data compression methods permitted more information be stored each individual sectors drive stores data onto cylinders heads sectors sectors unit smallest size data be stored hard disk drive each file will have many sectors units assigned smallest entity cd called frame which consists bytes contains six complete 16-bit stereo samples two bytes × two channels × six samples = bytes other nine bytes consist eight circ error-correction bytes one subcode byte used for control display information sent from computer processor bios into chip controlling data transfer this then sent out hard drive via multi-wire connector once data are received onto circuit board drive they are translated compressed into format that individual drive can use store onto disk itself data are then passed chip on circuit board that controls access drive drive divided into sectors data stored onto one sides one internal disks hdd with two disks internally will typically store data on all four surfaces hardware on drive tells actuator arm where go for relevant track compressed information then sent down head which changes physical properties optically magnetically for example each byte on drive thus storing information file not stored linear manner rather held best way for quickest retrieval rotation speed track layout comparison several forms disk storage showing tracks not-to-scale green denotes start red denotes end some cd-rw dvd-rw/dvd+rw recorders operate zclv caa cav modes mechanically there are two different motions occurring inside drive one rotation disks inside device other side-to-side motion head across disk moves between tracks there are two types disk rotation methods constant linear velocity used mainly optical storage varies rotational speed optical disc depending upon position head constant angular velocity used hdds standard fdds few optical disc systems vinyl audio records spins media at one constant speed regardless where head positioned track positioning also follows two different methods across disk storage devices storage devices focused on holding computer data eg hdds fdds iomega zip drives use concentric tracks store data during sequential read write operation after drive accesses all sectors track repositions heads next track this will cause momentary delay flow data between device computer contrast optical audio video discs use single spiral track that starts at inner most point on disc flows continuously outer edge when reading writing data there no need stop flow data switch tracks this similar vinyl records except vinyl records started at outer edge spiraled toward center interfaces disk drive interface mechanism/protocol communication between rest system disk drive itself storage devices intended for desktop mobile computers typically use ata pata sata interfaces enterprise systems high-end storage devices will typically use scsi sas fc interfaces addition some use sata basic terminology disk - generally refers magnetic media devices disc - required by trademarks for certain optical media devices platter – individual recording disk hard disk drive contains set platters developments optical technology have led multiple recording layers on dvds spindle – spinning axle on which platters are mounted rotation – platters rotate two techniques are common o constant angular velocity cav keeps disk spinning at fixed rate measured revolutions per minute rpm this means heads cover more distance per unit time on outer tracks than on inner tracks this method typical with computer hard drives o constant linear velocity clv keeps distance covered by heads per unit time fixed thus disk has slow down arm moves outer tracks this method typical for cd drives track – circle recorded data on single recording surface platter sector – segment track low level formatting – establishing tracks sectors head – device that reads writes information—magnetic optical—on disk surface arm – mechanical assembly that supports head moves out seek time – time needed move head new position specific track rotational latency – average time once arm on right track before head over desired sector data transfer rate - rate at which user data
